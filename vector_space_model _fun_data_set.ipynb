      "\n",
      "\"very true,\" said dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe, and\n",
      "rolled towards him a comfortable chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and what is the difficulty now?\" i asked. \"nothing more in the\n",

      "\"oh no; nothing of that nature. the fact is, the business is very simple\n",

      "\n",
      "\"simple and odd,\" said dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, yes; and not exactly that, either. the fact is, we have all been\n",
      "a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us\n",
      "altogether.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"a little too self-evident.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"and what, after all, is the matter on hand?\" i asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, i will tell you,\" replied the prefect, as he gave a long, steady\n",
      "and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. \"i will tell\n",
      "you in a few words; but, before i begin, let me caution you that this\n",
      "is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that i should most\n",
      "probably lose the position i now hold, were it known that i confided it\n",
      "to any one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"proceed,\" said i.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"or not,\" said dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, then; i have received personal information, from a very high\n",
      "quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been\n",
      "purloined from the royal apartments. the individual who purloined it is\n",
      "known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. it is known, also,\n",
      "that it still remains in his possession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how is this known?\" asked dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is clearly inferred,\" replied the prefect, \"from the nature of the\n",
      "document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at\n",
      "once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; that is to\n",
      "say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"be a little more explicit,\" i said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder\n",
      "a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\n",
      "valuable.\" the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"still i do not quite understand,\" said dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no? well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall\n",
      "be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most\n",
      "exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an\n",
      "ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so\n",
      "jeopardized.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but this ascendancy,\" i interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's\n",
      "knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. who would dare--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the thief,\" said g., \"is the minister d--, who dares all things, those\n",
      "unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. the method of the theft was\n",
      "not less ingenious than bold. the document in question--a letter, to\n",
      "be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the\n",
      "royal boudoir. during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the\n",
      "entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her\n",
      "wish to conceal it. after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in\n",
      "a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. the\n",
      "address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the\n",
      "letter escaped notice. at this juncture enters the minister d--. his\n",
      "lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting\n",
      "of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and\n",
      "fathoms her secret. after some business transactions, hurried through in\n",
      "his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one\n",
      "in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in\n",
      "close juxtaposition to the other. again he converses, for some fifteen\n",
      "minutes, upon the public affairs. at length, in taking leave, he takes\n",
      "also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. its rightful\n",
      "owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the\n",
      "presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. the minister\n",
      "decamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"here, then,\" said dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand\n",
      "to make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's\n",
      "knowledge of the robber.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" replied the prefect; \"and the power thus attained has, for some\n",
      "months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous\n",
      "extent. the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of\n",
      "the necessity of reclaiming her letter. but this, of course, cannot be\n",
      "done openly. in fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"than whom,\" said dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more\n",
      "sagacious agent could, i suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you flatter me,\" replied the prefect; \"but it is possible that some\n",
      "such opinion may have been entertained.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is clear,\" said i, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in\n",
      "possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any\n",
      "employment of the letter, which bestows the power. with the employment\n",
      "the power departs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"true,\" said g.; \"and upon this conviction i proceeded. my first care\n",
      "was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief\n",
      "embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.\n",
      "beyond all things, i have been warned of the danger which would result\n",
      "from giving him reason to suspect our design.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but,\" said i, \"you are quite au fait in these investigations. the\n",
      "parisian police have done this thing often before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"o yes; and for this reason i did not despair. the habits of the\n",
      "minister gave me, too, a great advantage. he is frequently absent from\n",
      "home all night. his servants are by no means numerous. they sleep at a\n",
      "distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly neapolitans,\n",
      "are readily made drunk. i have keys, as you know, with which i can\n",
      "open any chamber or cabinet in paris. for three months a night has\n",
      "not passed, during the greater part of which i have not been engaged,\n",
      "personally, in ransacking the d-- hotel. my honor is interested, and, to\n",
      "mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. so i did not abandon\n",
      "the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more\n",
      "astute man than myself. i fancy that i have investigated every nook and\n",
      "corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be\n",
      "concealed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but is it not possible,\" i suggested, \"that although the letter may\n",
      "be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have\n",
      "concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"this is barely possible,\" said dupin. \"the present peculiar condition\n",
      "of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which d--\n",
      "is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the\n",
      "document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a\n",
      "point of nearly equal importance with its possession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"its susceptibility of being produced?\" said i.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that is to say, of being destroyed,\" said dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"true,\" i observed; \"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. as for\n",
      "its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out\n",
      "of the question.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"entirely,\" said the prefect. \"he has been twice waylaid, as if by\n",
      "footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said dupin. \"d--, i\n",
      "presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated\n",
      "these waylayings, as a matter of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"not altogether a fool,\" said g., \"but then he's a poet, which i take to\n",
      "be only one remove from a fool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"true,\" said dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from\n",
      "his meerschaum, \"although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"suppose you detail,\" said i, \"the particulars of your search.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where. i have\n",
      "had long experience in these affairs. i took the entire building, room\n",
      "by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. we examined,\n",
      "first, the furniture of each apartment. we opened every possible drawer;\n",
      "and i presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a\n",
      "thing as a secret drawer is impossible. any man is a dolt who permits a\n",
      "'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. the thing is so\n",
      "plain. there is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for\n",
      "in every cabinet. then we have accurate rules. the fiftieth part of a\n",
      "line could not escape us. after the cabinets we took the chairs. the\n",
      "cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.\n",
      "from the tables we removed the tops.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of\n",
      "furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then\n",
      "the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the\n",
      "top replaced. the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same\n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" i asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"by no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding\n",
      "of cotton be placed around it. besides, in our case, we were obliged to\n",
      "proceed without noise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces all\n",
      "articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a\n",
      "deposit in the manner you mention. a letter may be compressed into\n",
      "a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large\n",
      "knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of\n",
      "a chair, for example. you did not take to pieces all the chairs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every\n",
      "chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of\n",
      "furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. had there been\n",
      "any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it\n",
      "instantly. a single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been\n",
      "as obvious as an apple. any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gaping\n",
      "in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,\n",
      "and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and\n",
      "carpets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of\n",
      "the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. we divided\n",
      "its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that\n",
      "none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch\n",
      "throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,\n",
      "with the microscope, as before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the two houses adjoining!\" i exclaimed; \"you must have had a great deal\n",
      "of trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"we had; but the reward offered is prodigious!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you include the grounds about the houses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"all the grounds are paved with brick. they gave us comparatively\n",
      "little trouble. we examined the moss between the bricks, and found it\n",
      "undisturbed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you looked among d--'s papers, of course, and into the books of the\n",
      "library?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened\n",
      "every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting\n",
      "ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our\n",
      "police officers. we also measured the thickness of every book-cover,\n",
      "with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most\n",
      "jealous scrutiny of the microscope. had any of the bindings been\n",
      "recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the\n",
      "fact should have escaped observation. some five or six volumes, just\n",
      "from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with\n",
      "the needles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you explored the floors beneath the carpets?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"beyond doubt. we removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the\n",
      "microscope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and the paper on the walls?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you looked into the cellars?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"we did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"then,\" i said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter\n",
      "is not upon the premises, as you suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i fear you are right there,\" said the prefect. \"and now, dupin, what\n",
      "would you advise me to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to make a thorough re-search of the premises.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that is absolutely needless,\" replied g--. \"i am not more sure that i\n",
      "breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have no better advice to give you,\" said dupin. \"you have, of course,\n",
      "an accurate description of the letter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh yes!\"--and here the prefect, producing a memorandum-book proceeded\n",
      "to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the\n",
      "external appearance of the missing document. soon after finishing\n",

      "depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before. in\n",
      "about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied\n",
      "very nearly as before. he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some\n",
      "ordinary conversation. at length i said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, but g--, what of the purloined letter? i presume you have at\n",
      "last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\n",
      "minister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"confound him, say i--yes; i made the re-examination, however, as dupin\n",
      "suggested--but it was all labor lost, as i knew it would be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked dupin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, a very great deal--a very liberal reward--i don't like to say how\n",
      "much, precisely; but one thing i will say, that i wouldn't mind giving\n",
      "my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could\n",
      "obtain me that letter. the fact is, it is becoming of more and more\n",
      "importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. if it were\n",
      "trebled, however, i could do no more than i have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, yes,\" said dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\n",
      "meerschaum, \"i really--think, g--, you have not exerted yourself--to the\n",
      "utmost in this matter. you might--do a little more, i think, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how?--in what way?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the\n",

      "abernethy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no; hang abernethy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to be sure! hang him and welcome. but, once upon a time, a certain rich\n",
      "miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical\n",
      "opinion. getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a\n",
      "private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an\n",
      "imaginary individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'we will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and\n",
      "such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'take!' said abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but,\" said the prefect, a little discomposed, \"i am perfectly willing\n",
      "to take advice, and to pay for it. i would really give fifty thousand\n",
      "francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"in that case,\" replied dupin, opening a drawer, and producing\n",
      "a check-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount\n",
      "mentioned. when you have signed it, i will hand you the letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i was astounded. the prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.\n",
      "for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking\n",
      "incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed\n",
      "starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some\n",
      "measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,\n",
      "finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and\n",
      "handed it across the table to dupin. the latter examined it carefully\n",
      "and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took\n",
      "thence a letter and gave it to the prefect. this functionary grasped it\n",
      "in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid\n",
      "glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the\n",
      "door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,\n",
      "without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill\n",
      "up the check.\n",
      "\n",
      "when he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their way.\n",
      "they are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the\n",
      "knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. thus, when g--\n",
      "detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d--,\n",
      "i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory\n",
      "investigation--so far as his labors extended.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"so far as his labors extended?\" said i.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" said dupin. \"the measures adopted were not only the best of\n",
      "their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. had the letter been\n",
      "deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond\n",
      "a question, have found it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well\n",
      "executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and\n",
      "to the man. a certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the\n",
      "prefect, a sort of procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his\n",
      "designs. but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for\n",
      "the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. i\n",
      "knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game\n",
      "of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. this game is simple,\n",
      "and is played with marbles. one player holds in his hand a number of\n",
      "these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.\n",
      "if the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. the\n",
      "boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school. of course he\n",
      "had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and\n",
      "admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. for example, an arrant\n",
      "simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are\n",
      "they even or odd?' our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the\n",
      "second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton\n",
      "had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just\n",
      "sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; i will therefore\n",
      "guess odd;'--he guesses odd, and wins. now, with a simpleton a degree\n",
      "above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'this fellow finds that in\n",
      "the first instance i guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to\n",
      "himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd,\n",
      "as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that\n",
      "this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting\n",
      "it even as before. i will therefore guess even;'--he guesses even, and\n",
      "wins. now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows\n",
      "termed 'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is merely,\" i said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect\n",
      "with that of his opponent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is,\" said dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\n",
      "effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, i\n",
      "received answer as follows: 'when i wish to find out how wise, or how\n",
      "stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts\n",
      "at the moment, i fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as\n",
      "possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see\n",
      "what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\n",
      "correspond with the expression.' this response of the schoolboy lies at\n",
      "the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to\n",
      "rochefoucault, to la bougive, to machiavelli, and to campanella.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and the identification,\" i said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with that\n",
      "of his opponent, depends, if i understand you aright, upon the accuracy\n",
      "with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"for its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied dupin; \"and the\n",
      "prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this\n",
      "identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through\n",
      "non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. they\n",
      "consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for\n",
      "anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have\n",
      "hidden it. they are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a\n",
      "faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the\n",
      "individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils\n",
      "them, of course. this always happens when it is above their own, and\n",
      "very usually when it is below. they have no variation of principle in\n",
      "their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by\n",
      "some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of\n",
      "practice, without touching their principles. what, for example, in this\n",
      "case of d--, has been done to vary the principle of action? what is\n",
      "all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the\n",
      "microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered\n",
      "square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of\n",
      "the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon\n",
      "the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the prefect,\n",
      "in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? do you not see he\n",
      "has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--not\n",
      "exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in some\n",
      "out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought\n",
      "which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in\n",
      "a chair-leg? and do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for\n",
      "concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be\n",
      "adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,\n",
      "a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherche\n",
      "manner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and\n",
      "thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether\n",
      "upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and\n",
      "where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in\n",
      "the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities in\n",
      "question have never been known to fail. you will now understand what i\n",
      "meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where\n",
      "within the limits of the prefect's examination--in other words, had the\n",
      "principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of\n",
      "the prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond\n",
      "question. this functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified;\n",
      "and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the\n",
      "minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. all fools\n",
      "are poets; this the prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non\n",
      "distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but is this really the poet?\" i asked. \"there are two brothers, i know;\n",
      "and both have attained reputation in letters. the minister i believe has\n",
      "written learnedly on the differential calculus. he is a mathematician,\n",
      "and no poet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are mistaken; i know him well; he is both. as poet and\n",
      "mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could\n",
      "not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the\n",
      "prefect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you surprise me,\" i said, \"by these opinions, which have been\n",
      "contradicted by the voice of the world. you do not mean to set at naught\n",
      "the well-digested idea of centuries. the mathematical reason has long\n",
      "been regarded as the reason par excellence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'il y a a parier,'\" replied dupin, quoting from chamfort, \"'que toute\n",

      "convenue au plus grand nombre.' the mathematicians, i grant you, have\n",

      "which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. with an\n",
      "art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term\n",
      "'analysis' into application to algebra. the french are the originators\n",
      "of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance--if\n",

      "i dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. the\n",
      "mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning\n",
      "is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. the great\n",
      "error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure\n",
      "algebra, are abstract or general truths. and this error is so egregious\n",
      "that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been\n",
      "received. mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. what is\n",
      "true of relation--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regard\n",
      "to morals, for example. in this latter science it is very usually untrue\n",
      "that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. in chemistry also the\n",
      "axiom fails. in the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,\n",
      "each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal\n",
      "to the sum of their values apart. there are numerous other mathematical\n",
      "truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. but the\n",
      "mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if\n",
      "they were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeed\n",
      "imagines them to be. bryant, in his very learned 'mythology,' mentions\n",
      "an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the pagan\n",
      "fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make\n",
      "inferences from them as existing realities.' with the algebraists,\n",
      "however, who are pagans themselves, the 'pagan fables' are believed, and\n",
      "the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as\n",
      "through an unaccountable addling of the brains. in short, i never yet\n",

      "last observations, \"that if the minister had been no more than a\n",
      "mathematician, the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving\n",
      "me this check. i know him, however, as both mathematician and poet,\n",
      "and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the\n",
      "circumstances by which he was surrounded. i knew him as a courtier, too,\n",

      "impress them with the conviction to which g--, in fact, did finally\n",
      "arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. i\n",
      "felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which i was at some pains\n",
      "in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of\n",
      "policial action in searches for articles concealed--i felt that this\n",
      "whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the\n",
      "minister. it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary\n",
      "nooks of concealment. he could not, i reflected, be so weak as not to\n",
      "see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be\n",
      "as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the\n",
      "gimlets, and to the microscopes of the prefect. i saw, in fine, that\n",
      "he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not\n",
      "deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. you will remember,\n",
      "perhaps, how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested, upon our\n",
      "first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so\n",
      "much on account of its being so very self-evident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" said i, \"i remember his merriment well. i really thought he would\n",
      "have fallen into convulsions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the material world,\" continued dupin, \"abounds with very strict\n",
      "analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been\n",
      "given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made\n",
      "to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. the\n",
      "principle of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in\n",
      "physics and metaphysics. it is not more true in the former, that a large\n",
      "body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that\n",
      "its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it\n",
      "is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more\n",
      "forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those\n",
      "of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed\n",
      "and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. again:\n",
      "have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors,\n",
      "are the most attractive of attention?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have never given the matter a thought,\" i said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a map.\n",
      "one party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of\n",
      "town, river, state or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and\n",
      "perplexed surface of the chart. a novice in the game generally seeks to\n",
      "embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;\n",
      "but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from\n",
      "one end of the chart to the other. these, like the over-largely lettered\n",
      "signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being\n",
      "excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely\n",
      "analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers\n",
      "to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too\n",
      "palpably self-evident. but this is a point, it appears, somewhat above\n",
      "or beneath the understanding of the prefect. he never once thought\n",
      "it probable, or possible, that the minister had deposited the letter\n",
      "immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best\n",
      "preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but the more i reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating\n",
      "ingenuity of d--; upon the fact that the document must always have been\n",
      "at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive\n",
      "evidence, obtained by the prefect, that it was not hidden within the\n",
      "limits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more satisfied i\n",
      "became that, to conceal this letter, the minister had resorted to the\n",
      "comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at\n",
      "all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"full of these ideas, i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,\n",

      "and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. he is, perhaps,\n",
      "the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when\n",
      "nobody sees him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to be even with him, i complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the\n",
      "necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which i cautiously and\n",

      "upon the conversation of my host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,\n",

      "\"at length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\n",

      "the mantel-piece. in this rack, which had three or four compartments,\n",
      "were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. this last\n",

      "extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. the upper lip,\n",
      "at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had\n",
      "previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible\n",

      "then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous\n",

      "there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as it\n",
      "would be madness in me to attempt describing. there are, indeed, two or\n",
      "three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; i\n",
      "might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;\n",
      "but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no\n",
      "similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. there were two\n",
      "particulars, nevertheless, which i thought then, and still think, might\n",
      "fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted to\n",
      "convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. in the first place, the\n",
      "voice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance,\n",
      "or from some deep cavern within the earth. in the second place, it\n",
      "impressed me (i fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself\n",

      "touch.\n",
      "\n",

      "been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees--degrees nearly\n",
      "imperceptible, and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject\n",
      "as fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of\n",

      "could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without\n",
      "the risk of being observed by the neighbors. many projects entered\n",
      "my mind. at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute\n",
      "fragments, and destroying them by fire. at another, i resolved to dig\n",
      "a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. again, i deliberated about\n",
      "casting it in the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as if\n",
      "merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to\n",
      "take it from the house. finally i hit upon what i considered a far\n",
      "better expedient than either of these. i determined to wall it up in the\n",
      "cellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up\n",
      "their victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. its walls were\n",
      "loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a\n",
      "rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from\n",
      "hardening. moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by\n",
      "a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to\n",
      "resemble the red of the cellar. i made no doubt that i could readily\n",
      "displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole\n",
      "up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. and in\n",
      "this calculation i was not deceived. by means of a crow-bar i easily\n",
      "dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against\n",
      "the inner wall, i propped it in that position, while, with little\n",
      "trouble, i re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. having\n",
      "procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, i\n",
      "prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and\n",
      "with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork. when i had\n",
      "finished, i felt satisfied that all was right. the wall did not present\n",
      "the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. the rubbish on\n",
      "the floor was picked up with the minutest care. i looked around\n",
      "triumphantly, and said to myself--\"here at least, then, my labor has not\n",
      "been in vain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so\n",
      "much wretchedness; for i had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to\n",
      "death. had i been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have\n",
      "been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had\n",
      "been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to\n",

      "upon my future felicity as secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,\n",
      "very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous\n",

      "my place of concealment, i felt no embarrassment whatever. the officers\n",
      "bade me accompany them in their search. they left no nook or corner\n",
      "unexplored. at length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into\n",
      "the cellar. i quivered not in a muscle. my heart beat calmly as that of\n",

      "the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,\n",

      "me into the presence of his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty. the windows\n",
      "were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black\n",
      "oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. feeble gleams\n",

      "upon my entrance, usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at\n",
      "full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in\n",
      "it, i at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained\n",
      "effort of the _ennuye_ man of the world. a glance, however, at his\n",
      "countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. we sat down; and for\n",
      "some moments, while he spoke not, i gazed upon him with a feeling half\n",
      "of pity, half of awe. surely, man had never before so terribly altered,\n",

      "had been at all times remarkable. a cadaverousness of complexion; an eye\n",
      "large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and\n",
      "very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a\n",
      "delicate hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar\n",
      "formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,\n",
      "of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\n",
      "tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions\n",
      "of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be\n",
      "forgotten. and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character\n",
      "of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay\n",
      "so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke. the now ghastly pallor\n",
      "of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things\n",
      "startled and even awed me. the silken hair, too, had been suffered to\n",
      "grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated\n",
      "rather than fell about the face, i could not, even with effort, connect\n",
      "its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence--an\n",
      "inconsistency; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble\n",

      "nervous agitation. for something of this nature i had indeed been\n",
      "prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain\n",
      "boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical\n",

      "sullen. his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the\n",

      "concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding\n",

      "them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and\n",
      "the general manner of the narration had their weight. he suffered much\n",
      "from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone\n",
      "endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors\n",
      "of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint\n",
      "light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed\n",
      "instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\n",
      "\n",

      "which the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn\n",

      "illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly\n",

      "weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and\n",

      "\n",
      "the \"red death\" had long devastated the country. no pestilence had ever\n",
      "been so fatal, or so hideous. blood was its avatar and its seal--the\n",
      "redness and the horror of blood. there were sharp pains, and sudden\n",
      "dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. the\n",
      "scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,\n",
      "were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy\n",
      "of his fellow-men. and the whole seizure, progress and termination of\n",
      "the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. when his\n",
      "dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand\n",
      "hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of\n",
      "his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his\n",
      "castellated abbeys. this was an extensive and magnificent structure, the\n",
      "creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. a strong and\n",
      "lofty wall girdled it in. this wall had gates of iron. the courtiers,\n",
      "having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.\n",
      "they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden\n",
      "impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. the abbey was amply\n",
      "provisioned. with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to\n",
      "contagion. the external world could take care of itself. in the meantime\n",
      "it was folly to grieve, or to think. the prince had provided all the\n",
      "appliances of pleasure. there were buffoons, there were improvisatori,\n",
      "there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was beauty,\n",
      "there was wine. all these and security were within. without was the \"red\n",
      "death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\n",
      "and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the prince\n",
      "prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\n",
      "unusual magnificence.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. but first let me tell of the\n",
      "rooms in which it was held. there were seven--an imperial suite. in many\n",
      "palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the\n",
      "folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that\n",
      "the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. here the case was\n",
      "very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the\n",
      "bizarre. the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision\n",
      "embraced but little more than one at a time. there was a sharp turn at\n",
      "every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. to the\n",
      "right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow gothic\n",
      "window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of\n",
      "the suite. these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in\n",
      "accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber\n",
      "into which it opened. that at the eastern extremity was hung, for\n",
      "example, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. the second chamber\n",
      "was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were\n",
      "purple. the third was green throughout, and so were the casements. the\n",
      "fourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth with white--the\n",
      "sixth with violet. the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black\n",
      "velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,\n",
      "falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. but\n",
      "in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with\n",
      "the decorations. the panes here were scarlet--a deep blood color. now in\n",
      "no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid\n",
      "the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or\n",
      "depended from the roof. there was no light of any kind emanating from\n",
      "lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. but in the corridors\n",
      "that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy\n",
      "tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the\n",
      "tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. and thus were produced\n",
      "a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. but in the western or\n",
      "black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark\n",
      "hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and\n",
      "produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered,\n",
      "that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its\n",
      "precincts at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\n",
      "wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. its pendulum swung to and fro with a\n",
      "dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit\n",
      "of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the\n",
      "brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and\n",
      "exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at\n",
      "each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained\n",
      "to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound;\n",
      "and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a\n",
      "brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the\n",
      "clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the\n",
      "more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in\n",
      "confused reverie or meditation. but when the echoes had fully ceased,\n",
      "a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at\n",
      "each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made\n",
      "whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock\n",
      "should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of\n",
      "sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of\n",
      "the time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,\n",
      "and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "but, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.\n",
      "the tastes of the duke were peculiar. he had a fine eye for colors and\n",
      "effects. he disregarded the decora of mere fashion. his plans were bold\n",
      "and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. there are\n",
      "some who would have thought him mad. his followers felt that he was not.\n",
      "it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was\n",
      "not.\n",
      "\n",
      "he had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven\n",
      "chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding\n",
      "taste which had given character to the masqueraders. be sure they\n",
      "were grotesque. there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\n",
      "phantasm--much of what has been since seen in \"hernani.\" there were\n",
      "arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. there were\n",
      "delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. there was much of the\n",
      "beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the\n",
      "terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.\n",
      "to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of\n",
      "dreams. and these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from the\n",
      "rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo\n",
      "of their steps. and, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in\n",
      "the hall of the velvet. and then, for a moment, all is still, and all is\n",
      "silent save the voice of the clock. the dreams are stiff-frozen as they\n",
      "stand. but the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but an\n",
      "instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they\n",
      "depart. and now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe\n",
      "to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted\n",
      "windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. but to the\n",
      "chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of\n",
      "the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a\n",
      "ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the\n",
      "sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,\n",
      "there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly\n",
      "emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more\n",
      "remote gaieties of the other apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "but these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\n",
      "feverishly the heart of life. and the revel went whirlingly on, until at\n",
      "length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. and then\n",
      "the music ceased, as i have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers\n",
      "were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.\n",
      "but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the\n",
      "clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with\n",
      "more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who\n",
      "revelled. and thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last\n",
      "echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many\n",
      "individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the\n",
      "presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no\n",
      "single individual before. and the rumor of this new presence having\n",
      "spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the\n",
      "whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and\n",
      "surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted, it may well be\n",
      "supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.\n",
      "in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but\n",
      "the figure in question had out-heroded herod, and gone beyond the bounds\n",
      "of even the prince's indefinite decorum. there are chords in the hearts\n",
      "of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. even with\n",
      "the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are\n",
      "matters of which no jest can be made. the whole company, indeed, seemed\n",
      "now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger\n",
      "neither wit nor propriety existed. the figure was tall and gaunt, and\n",
      "shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. the\n",
      "mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the\n",
      "countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have\n",
      "had difficulty in detecting the cheat. and yet all this might have been\n",
      "endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. but the mummer\n",
      "had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death. his vesture was\n",
      "dabbled in blood--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,\n",
      "was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image (which\n",
      "with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,\n",
      "stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in\n",
      "the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;\n",
      "but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"who dares?\" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\n",
      "him--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? seize him and\n",
      "unmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the\n",
      "battlements!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero\n",
      "as he uttered these words. they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly\n",
      "and clearly--for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had\n",
      "become hushed at the waving of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale\n",
      "courtiers by his side. at first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing\n",
      "movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the\n",
      "moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step,\n",
      "made closer approach to the speaker. but from a certain nameless awe\n",
      "with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole\n",
      "party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,\n",
      "unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while\n",
      "the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of\n",
      "the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\n",
      "same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the\n",
      "first, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to\n",
      "the green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the\n",
      "white--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been\n",
      "made to arrest him. it was then, however, that the prince prospero,\n",
      "maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed\n",
      "hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account\n",
      "of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. he bore aloft a drawn\n",
      "dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or\n",
      "four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the\n",
      "extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his\n",
      "pursuer. there was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the\n",
      "sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death\n",
      "the prince prospero. then, summoning the wild courage of despair,\n",
      "a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black\n",
      "apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and\n",
      "motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable\n",
      "horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they\n",
      "handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\n",
      "\n",
      "and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death. he had come\n",
      "like a thief in the night. and one by one dropped the revellers in the\n",
      "blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\n",
      "posture of his fall. and the life of the ebony clock went out with\n",
      "that of the last of the gay. and the flames of the tripods expired. and\n",
      "darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all.\n",

      "when he ventured upon insult, i vowed revenge. you, who so well know the\n",
      "nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that i gave utterance to\n",
      "a threat. _at length_ i would be avenged; this was a point definitively\n",
      "settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,\n",
      "precluded the idea of risk. i must not only punish, but punish with\n",

      "\n",

      "my _roquelaire_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"but let us proceed to\n",
      "the amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"be it so,\" i said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again\n",
      "offering him my arm. he leaned upon it heavily. we continued our route\n",
      "in search of the amontillado. we passed through a range of low arches,\n",
      "descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in\n",
      "which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than\n",
      "flame.\n",
      "\n",
      "at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\n",
      "spacious. its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\n",
      "vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris. three\n",
      "sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. from\n",
      "the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon\n",
      "the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. within the wall\n",
      "thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still\n",
      "interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height\n",
      "six or seven. it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use\n",
      "in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal\n",
      "supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their\n",
      "circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was in vain that fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to\n",
      "pry into the depths of the recess. its termination the feeble light did\n",
      "not enable us to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"proceed,\" i said; \"herein is the amontillado. as for luchesi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\n",
      "forward, while i followed immediately at his heels. in an instant he had\n",
      "reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested\n",
      "by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. a moment more and i had fettered\n",
      "him to the granite. in its surface were two iron staples, distant from\n",
      "each other about two feet, horizontally. from one of these depended\n",
      "a short chain, from the other a padlock. throwing the links about his\n",
      "waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. he was too\n",
      "much astounded to resist. withdrawing the key i stepped back from the\n",
      "recess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"pass your hand,\" i said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\n",
      "nitre. indeed it is _very_ damp. once more let me _implore_ you to\n",
      "return. no? then i must positively leave you. but i must first render\n",
      "you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"true,\" i replied; \"the amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i\n",
      "have before spoken. throwing them aside, i soon uncovered a quantity of\n",
      "building stone and mortar. with these materials and with the aid of my\n",
      "trowel, i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n",
      "\n",
      "i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered\n",
      "that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off. the\n",
      "earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\n",
      "of the recess. it was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. there was then a\n",
      "long and obstinate silence. i laid the second tier, and the third, and\n",
      "the fourth; and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain. the\n",
      "noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that i might hearken to\n",
      "it with the more satisfaction, i ceased my labors and sat down upon the\n",
      "bones. when at last the clanking subsided, i resumed the trowel, and\n",
      "finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\n",
      "tier. the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. i again\n",
      "paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\n",
      "feeble rays upon the figure within.\n",
      "\n",
      "a succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\n",
      "throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. for a\n",
      "brief moment i hesitated--i trembled. unsheathing my rapier, i began to\n",
      "grope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassured\n",
      "me. i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt\n",
      "satisfied. i reapproached the wall. i replied to the yells of him\n",
      "who clamored. i re-echoed--i aided--i surpassed them in volume and in\n",
      "strength. i did this, and the clamorer grew still.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. i had completed\n",
      "the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. i had finished a portion\n",
      "of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to\n",
      "be fitted and plastered in. i struggled with its weight; i placed it\n",
      "partially in its destined position. but now there came from out the\n",
      "niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. it was succeeded\n",
      "by a sad voice, which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the\n",
      "noble fortunato. the voice said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. we\n",
      "will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over\n",
      "our wine--he! he! he!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "and the rest? let us be gone.\"\n",

      "no answer. i called again--\n",

      "\n",
      "no answer still. i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let\n",

      "my heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. i\n",
      "hastened to make an end of my labor. i forced the last stone into its\n",

      "certain antique narratives had inspired me. this process, however,\n",
      "afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as\n",
      "i might make its circuit, and return to the point whence i set out,\n",
      "without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.\n",
      "i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led\n",
      "into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been\n",

      "of departure. the difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,\n",

      "more;--when i arrived at the rag. there were in all, then, a hundred\n",
      "paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, i presumed the dungeon to\n",
      "be fifty yards in circuit. i had met, however, with many angles in the\n",
      "wall, and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for\n",

      "to cross the area of the enclosure. at first i proceeded with extreme\n",
      "caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was\n",
      "treacherous with slime. at length, however, i took courage, and did not\n",
      "hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as\n",
      "possible. i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when\n",
      "the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.\n",
      "i stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "in the confusion attending my fall, i did not immediately apprehend a\n",
      "somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,\n",
      "and while i still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. it was this--my\n",
      "chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper\n",
      "portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the\n",
      "chin, touched nothing. at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in\n",
      "a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my\n",
      "nostrils. i put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that i had fallen\n",
      "at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, i had\n",
      "no means of ascertaining at the moment. groping about the masonry just\n",
      "below the margin, i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it\n",
      "fall into the abyss. for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberations\n",
      "as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length\n",
      "there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. at the\n",
      "same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as\n",
      "rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed\n",
      "suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.\n",
      "\n",
      "i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated\n",
      "myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped. another step\n",
      "before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. and the death just\n",
      "avoided, was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and\n",
      "frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition. to the victims of its\n",
      "tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,\n",
      "or death with its most hideous moral horrors. i had been reserved for\n",
      "the latter. by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until i\n",
      "trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a\n",
      "fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.\n",
      "\n",
      "shaking in every limb, i groped my way back to the wall; resolving\n",
      "there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my\n",
      "imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.\n",
      "in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at\n",
      "once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now i was the veriest of\n",
      "cowards. neither could i forget what i had read of these pits--that the\n",

      "\n",
      "agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length i\n",

      "visible. by a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which i could not\n",

      "prison.\n",

      "nostrils. i prayed--i wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy\n",
      "descent. i grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward\n",
      "against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. and then i fell suddenly\n",

      "who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at\n",
      "pleasure. upon my recovery, too, i felt very--oh, inexpressibly sick\n",
      "and weak, as if through long inanition. even amid the agonies of that\n",
      "period, the human nature craved food. with painful effort i outstretched\n",
      "my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the\n",
      "small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. as i put a portion\n",
      "of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of\n",
      "joy--of hope. yet what business had i with hope? it was, as i say, a\n",
      "half formed thought--man has many such which are never completed. i felt\n",

      "that prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. it was hope--the\n",

      "even in the dungeons of the inquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual\n",

      "instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. but\n",
      "the alteration stopped not here-i neither hoped nor desired it to stop.\n",

      "improvement at this one point, was a mystery i had been unable to solve.\n",
      "my own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive\n",
      "intention of nature would have so arranged the earth's surface as to\n",
      "have fulfilled at all points man's sense of perfection in the beautiful,\n",

      "the soul of art. the force of this idea was much weakened, however, by\n",
      "the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal\n",

      "they were prognostic of death. he thus explained:--admit the earthly\n",
      "immortality of man to have been the first intention. we have then the\n",
      "primitive arrangement of the earth's surface adapted to his blissful\n",
      "estate, as not existent but designed. the disturbances were the\n",

      "beyond the limits of its atmosphere. it is easily understood that what\n",

      "a general or more distantly observed effect. there may be a class of\n",
      "beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,\n",

      "in the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a\n",

      "his theme:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural\n",
      "and the artificial. one seeks to recall the original beauty of the\n",
      "country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating\n",
      "trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;\n",
      "detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,\n",
      "proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed\n",
      "everywhere to the experienced student of nature. the result of the\n",
      "natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all\n",
      "defects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and\n",
      "order--than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. the\n",
      "artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes\n",
      "to gratify. it has a certain general relation to the various styles of\n",
      "building. there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles;\n",
      "italian terraces; and a various mixed old english style, which\n",
      "bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan\n",
      "architecture. whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial\n",
      "landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it\n",
      "a great beauty. this is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of\n",
      "order and design, and partly moral. a terrace, with an old moss-covered\n",
      "balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed\n",
      "there in other days. the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of\n",
      "care and human interest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"from what i have already observed,\" said ellison, \"you will understand\n",
      "that i reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty\n",
      "of the country. the original beauty is never so great as that which may\n",
      "be introduced. of course, every thing depends on the selection of a\n",
      "spot with capabilities. what is said about detecting and bringing into\n",
      "practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those\n",
      "mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.\n",
      "the phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no\n",
      "degree. that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen\n",
      "rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the\n",
      "creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better\n",
      "suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid\n",
      "dreams of the man of genius. the negative merit suggested appertains to\n",
      "that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate addison into\n",
      "apotheosis. in truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere\n",
      "avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be\n",
      "circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can\n",
      "be apprehended in its results alone. rule applies but to the merits of\n",
      "denial--to the excellencies which refrain. beyond these, the critical\n",

      "there may be something beyond it. there may be an object in keeping with\n",
      "the principle--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed\n",

      "my friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes\n",
      "of visiters, has given to arnheim a species of secret and subdued if\n",
      "not solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in\n",
      "degree, to that which so long distinguished fonthill.\n",
      "\n",
      "the usual approach to arnheim was by the river. the visiter left the\n",

      "their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. by\n",
      "degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral\n",
      "care. this slowly became merged in a sense of retirement--this again in\n",
      "a consciousness of solitude. as the evening approached, the channel grew\n",
      "more narrow, the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter\n",
      "were clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. the water\n",
      "increased in transparency. the stream took a thousand turns, so that at\n",
      "no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance\n",
      "than a furlong. at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an\n",
      "enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,\n",
      "a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor--the keel balancing itself\n",
      "with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident\n",
      "having been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the\n",
      "substantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. the channel now\n",
      "became a gorge--although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and i employ\n",
      "it merely because the language has no word which better represents\n",
      "the most striking--not the most distinctive--feature of the scene. the\n",
      "character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of\n",
      "the shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. the walls of\n",
      "the ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose\n",
      "to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty\n",
      "feet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, to\n",
      "shut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended\n",
      "densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole\n",
      "chasm an air of funereal gloom. the windings became more frequent and\n",
      "intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, so\n",
      "that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. he was, moreover,\n",
      "enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. the thought of nature\n",
      "still remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification,\n",
      "there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety\n",
      "in these her works. not a dead branch--not a withered leaf--not a stray\n",
      "pebble--not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. the crystal\n",
      "water welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with\n",
      "a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom\n",
      "deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel\n",
      "brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of\n",
      "very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. it\n",
      "was about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but\n",
      "one--that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered--by hills equal\n",
      "in general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly\n",
      "different character. their sides sloped from the water's edge at an\n",
      "angle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to\n",
      "summit--not a perceptible point escaping--in a drapery of the most\n",
      "gorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the\n",
      "sea of odorous and fluctuating color. this basin was of great depth, but\n",
      "so transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of\n",
      "a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible\n",
      "by glimpses--that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not\n",
      "to see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the\n",
      "hills. on these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size.\n",
      "the impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,\n",
      "warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness,\n",
      "voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested\n",
      "dreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and\n",
      "fastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from\n",
      "its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the\n",
      "folds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy\n",
      "a panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes,\n",
      "rolling silently out of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "the visiter, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the\n",
      "ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,\n",
      "which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now\n",
      "confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless\n",
      "vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and\n",
      "descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in\n",
      "vivid scarlet, both within and without. the poop and beak of this boat\n",
      "arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form\n",
      "is that of an irregular crescent. it lies on the surface of the bay\n",
      "with the proud grace of a swan. on its ermined floor reposes a single\n",
      "feathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be\n",
      "seen. the guest is bidden to be of good cheer--that the fates will take\n",
      "care of him. the larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the\n",
      "canoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.\n",
      "while he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a\n",
      "gentle movement in the fairy bark. it slowly swings itself around until\n",
      "its prow points toward the sun. it advances with a gentle but gradually\n",
      "accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break\n",
      "about the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possible\n",
      "explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin\n",
      "the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "the canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is\n",
      "approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. to the\n",
      "right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. it is\n",
      "observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank\n",
      "dips into the water, still prevails. there is not one token of the usual\n",
      "river debris. to the left the character of the scene is softer and more\n",
      "obviously artificial. here the bank slopes upward from the stream in\n",
      "a very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture\n",
      "resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which\n",
      "would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. this plateau\n",
      "varies in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the\n",
      "river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of\n",
      "curves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost in\n",
      "the distance to the westward. this wall is of one continuous rock, and\n",
      "has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of\n",
      "the stream's southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered\n",
      "to remain. the chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely\n",
      "overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the\n",
      "eglantine, and the clematis. the uniformity of the top and bottom lines\n",
      "of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height,\n",
      "growing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in the\n",
      "domain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequent\n",
      "limbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent\n",
      "extremities into the water. farther back within the domain, the vision\n",
      "is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "these things are observed during the canoe's gradual approach to what i\n",
      "have called the gate of the vista. on drawing nearer to this, however,\n",
      "its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is\n",
      "discovered to the left--in which direction the wall is also seen to\n",
      "sweep, still following the general course of the stream. down this new\n",
      "opening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied\n",
      "by the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the\n",
      "leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "the boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and\n",
      "here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite\n",

      "mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in\n",
      "the scene.\n",

      "itself--(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto\n",
      "mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)--were to be seen three\n",
      "insulated trees. one was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it\n",
      "stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. another was a hickory,\n",
      "much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although\n",
      "both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the\n",
      "northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws\n",
      "of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly\n",
      "forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. about\n",
      "thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,\n",
      "and beyond all question the most magnificent tree i have ever seen,\n",

      "and twenty feet. nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,\n",
      "vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. in the present instance\n",

      "closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent\n",
      "tulips! only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture i would\n",
      "convey. and then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated\n",
      "columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the\n",
      "ground. the innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees\n",
      "scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the\n",
      "valley with more than arabian perfumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as\n",
      "that i had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,\n",
      "velvety, and miraculously green. it was hard to conceive how all this\n",
      "beauty had been attained.\n",
      "\n",
      "i have spoken of two openings into the vale. from the one to the\n",
      "northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly\n",
      "foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out\n",
      "of which sprang the insulated hickory. here, after encircling the tree,\n",
      "it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some\n",
      "twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course\n",
      "until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries\n",
      "of the valley. at this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at\n",
      "right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it\n",
      "went--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although\n",
      "roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.\n",
      "this lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest\n",
      "part. no crystal could be clearer than its waters. its bottom, which\n",
      "could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly\n",
      "white. its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded,\n",
      "rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was\n",
      "this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above\n",
      "it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced,\n",
      "it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. the trout, and\n",
      "some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost\n",
      "inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.\n",
      "it was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely\n",
      "suspended in the air. a light birch canoe that lay placidly on the\n",
      "water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed\n",
      "by the most exquisitely polished mirror. a small island, fairly laughing\n",
      "with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just\n",
      "enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose\n",
      "from the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected\n",
      "by means of an inconceivably light--looking and yet very primitive\n",
      "bridge. it was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip\n",
      "wood. this was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore\n",
      "and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all\n",
      "oscillation. from the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation\n",
      "of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,\n",
      "finally passed through the \"depression\" (already described) in the\n",
      "middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of\n",
      "a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the hudson.\n",
      "\n",
      "the lake was deep--at some points thirty feet--but the rivulet seldom\n",
      "exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. its bottom and\n",
      "banks were as those of the pond--if a defect could have been attributed,\n",
      "in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.\n",
      "\n",
      "the expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an\n",
      "occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,\n",
      "or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums\n",
      "blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. these latter grew in pots\n",
      "which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the\n",
      "appearance of being indigenous. besides all this, the lawn's velvet was\n",
      "exquisitely spotted with sheep--a considerable flock of which roamed\n",
      "about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of\n",
      "brilliantly-plumed ducks. a very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant\n",
      "attendance upon these animals, each and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "along the eastern and western cliffs--where, toward the upper portion of\n",
      "the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous--grew ivy\n",
      "in great profusion--so that only here and there could even a glimpse of\n",
      "the naked rock be obtained. the northern precipice, in like manner,\n",
      "was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some\n",
      "springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges\n",
      "on its face.\n",
      "\n",
      "the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little\n",
      "domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to\n",
      "prevent the escape of the deer. nothing of the fence kind was observable\n",
      "elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:--any\n",
      "stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of\n",
      "the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested,\n",
      "after a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which\n",
      "tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as i first drew near\n",
      "the domain. in short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate\n",
      "occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which\n",
      "i stopped to reconnoitre the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "i have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the\n",
      "whole of its course. its two general directions, as i have said, were\n",
      "first from west to east, and then from north to south. at the turn, the\n",
      "stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a\n",
      "peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the\n",
      "sixteenth of an acre. on this peninsula stood a dwelling-house--and when\n",
      "i say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by vathek, \"etait\n",

      "words just employed, i could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract,\n",
      "a more rigorous definition)--and i do not mean that merely outre was\n",
      "perceptible in any respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "in fact nothing could well be more simple--more utterly unpretending\n",
      "than this cottage. its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic\n",
      "arrangement as a picture. i could have fancied, while i looked at it,\n",
      "that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "the point of view from which i first saw the valley, was not altogether,\n",
      "although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.\n",
      "i will therefore describe it as i afterwards saw it--from a position on\n",
      "the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "the main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen\n",
      "broad--certainly not more. its total height, from the ground to the apex\n",
      "of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. to the west end\n",
      "of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its\n",
      "proportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards from\n",

      "the middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general,\n",
      "one-third less than the western wing. the roofs of the two larger were\n",
      "very steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve,\n",
      "and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to\n",
      "form the roofs of two piazzas. these latter roofs, of course, needed\n",
      "no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly\n",
      "plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. the roof of the\n",
      "northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.\n",
