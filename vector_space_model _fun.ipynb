      "hundreds of years afterward, he heard from a bird, from a wild animal,\n",
      "or in some manner which it is not now easy to find out, that there was\n",
      "a likeness of him on the old church in the distant town. now this\n",
      "griffin had no idea how he looked. he had never seen a mirror, and the\n",
      "streams where he lived were so turbulent and violent that a quiet\n",
      "piece of water, which would reflect the image of anything looking into\n",
      "it, could not be found. being, as far as could be ascertained, the\n",
      "very last of his race, he had never seen another griffin. therefore it\n",

      "very anxious to know what he looked like, and at last he determined to\n",
      "go to the old church, and see for himself what manner of being he was.\n",
      "so he started off from the dreadful wilds, and flew on and on until he\n",
      "came to the countries inhabited by men, where his appearance in the\n",
      "air created great consternation; but he alighted nowhere, keeping up a\n",
      "steady flight until he reached the suburbs of the town which had his\n",
      "image on its church. here, late in the afternoon, he alighted in a\n",
      "green meadow by the side of a brook, and stretched himself on the\n",
      "grass to rest. his great wings were tired, for he had not made such a\n",

      "called loudly for some one to come to him, but the more he called, the\n",
      "more afraid the people were to show themselves. at length he saw two\n",
      "laborers hurrying to their homes through the fields, and in a terrible\n",

      "trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what is the matter with you all?\" cried the griffin. \"is there not a\n",

      "\n",
      "the minor canon, who filled a subordinate position in the church, had\n",
      "just finished the afternoon services, and was coming out of a side\n",
      "door, with three aged women who had formed the week-day congregation.\n",
      "he was a young man of a kind disposition, and very anxious to do good\n",
      "to the people of the town. apart from his duties in the church, where\n",
      "he conducted services every week-day, he visited the sick and the\n",
      "poor, counseled and assisted persons who were in trouble, and taught a\n",

      "nobody else would have anything to do. whenever the people wanted\n",
      "something difficult done for them, they always went to the minor\n",

      "the town because he was not brave enough to obey the summons of the\n",

      "\n",
      "the minor canon did not feel very courageous, but he bowed his head.\n",

      "\n",
      "the minor canon looked at the frightful creature before him and saw\n",
      "that it was, without doubt, exactly like the stone image on the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"well, then,\" said the griffin, \"will you take me to it? i wish very\n",
      "much to see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the minor canon instantly thought that if the griffin entered the town\n",
      "without the people knowing what he came for, some of them would\n",
      "probably be frightened to death, and so he sought to gain time to\n",
      "prepare their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is growing dark, now,\" he said, very much afraid, as he spoke,\n",
      "that his words might enrage the griffin, \"and objects on the front of\n",
      "the church cannot be seen clearly. it will be better to wait until\n",
      "morning, if you wish to get a good view of the stone image of\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that will suit me very well,\" said the griffin. \"i see you are a man\n",
      "of good sense. i am tired, and i will take a nap here on this soft\n",
      "grass, while i cool my tail in the little stream that runs near me.\n",
      "the end of my tail gets red-hot when i am angry or excited, and it is\n",
      "quite warm now. so you may go, but be sure and come early to-morrow\n",
      "morning, and show me the way to the church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the minor canon was glad enough to take his leave, and hurried into\n",
      "the town. in front of the church he found a great many people\n",
      "assembled to hear his report of his interview with the griffin. when\n",
      "they found that he had not come to spread ruin and devastation, but\n",
      "simply to see his stony likeness on the church, they showed neither\n",
      "relief nor gratification, but began to upbraid the minor canon for\n",
      "consenting to conduct the creature into the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what could i do?\" cried the young man, \"if i should not bring him he\n",

      "his red-hot tail.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "still the people were not satisfied, and a great many plans were\n",
      "proposed to prevent the griffin from coming into the town. some\n",
      "elderly persons urged that the young men should go out and kill him;\n",
      "but the young men scoffed at such a ridiculous idea. then some one\n",
      "said that it would be a good thing to destroy the stone image so that\n",
      "the griffin would have no excuse for entering the town; and this\n",
      "proposal was received with such favor that many of the people ran for\n",
      "hammers, chisels, and crowbars, with which to tear down and break up\n",
      "the stone griffin. but the minor canon resisted this plan with all the\n",
      "strength of his mind and body. he assured the people that this action\n",
      "would enrage the griffin beyond measure, for it would be impossible to\n",
      "conceal from him that his image had been destroyed during the night.\n",
      "but the people were so determined to break up the stone griffin that\n",
      "the minor canon saw that there was nothing for him to do but to stay\n",
      "there and protect it. all night he walked up and down in front of the\n",
      "church-door, keeping away the men who brought ladders, by which they\n",
      "might mount to the great stone griffin, and knock it to pieces with\n",
      "their hammers and crowbars. after many hours the people were obliged\n",
      "to give up their attempts, and went home to sleep; but the minor canon\n",
      "remained at his post till early morning, and then he hurried away to\n",
      "the field where he had left the griffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "the monster had just awakened, and rising to his fore-legs and shaking\n",
      "himself, he said that he was ready to go into the town. the minor\n",
      "canon, therefore, walked back, the griffin flying slowly through the\n",
      "air, at a short distance above the head of his guide. not a person was\n",
      "to be seen in the streets, and they proceeded directly to the front of\n",
      "the church, where the minor canon pointed out the stone griffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "the real griffin settled down in the little square before the church\n",
      "and gazed earnestly at his sculptured likeness. for a long time he\n",
      "looked at it. first he put his head on one side, and then he put it on\n",
      "the other; then he shut his right eye and gazed with his left, after\n",
      "which he shut his left eye and gazed with his right. then he moved a\n",
      "little to one side and looked at the image, then he moved the other\n",
      "way. after a while he said to the minor canon, who had been standing\n",
      "by all this time:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is, it must be, an excellent likeness! that breadth between the\n",
      "eyes, that expansive forehead, those massive jaws! i feel that it must\n",
      "resemble me. if there is any fault to find with it, it is that the\n",
      "neck seems a little stiff. but that is nothing. it is an admirable\n",
      "likeness,--admirable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the griffin sat looking at his image all the morning and all the\n",
      "afternoon. the minor canon had been afraid to go away and leave him,\n",
      "and had hoped all through the day that he would soon be satisfied with\n",
      "his inspection and fly away home. but by evening the poor young man\n",
      "was utterly exhausted, and felt that he must eat and sleep. he frankly\n",
      "admitted this fact to the griffin, and asked him if he would not like\n",
      "something to eat. he said this because he felt obliged in politeness\n",
      "to do so, but as soon as he had spoken the words, he was seized with\n",
      "dread lest the monster should demand half a dozen babies, or some\n",
      "tempting repast of that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, no,\" said the griffin, \"i never eat between the equinoxes. at the\n",
      "vernal and at the autumnal equinox i take a good meal, and that lasts\n",
      "me for half a year. i am extremely regular in my habits, and do not\n",
      "think it healthful to eat at odd times. but if you need food, go and\n",
      "get it, and i will return to the soft grass where i slept last night\n",
      "and take another nap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the next day the griffin came again to the little square before the\n",
      "church, and remained there until evening, steadfastly regarding the\n",
      "stone griffin over the door. the minor canon came once or twice to\n",
      "look at him, and the griffin seemed very glad to see him; but the\n",
      "young clergyman could not stay as he had done before, for he had many\n",
      "duties to perform. nobody went to the church, but the people came to\n",
      "the minor canon's house, and anxiously asked him how long the griffin\n",
      "was going to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i do not know,\" he answered, \"but i think he will soon be satisfied\n",
      "with regarding his stone likeness, and then he will go away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "but the griffin did not go away. morning after morning he came to the\n",
      "church, but after a time he did not stay there all day. he seemed to\n",
      "have taken a great fancy to the minor canon, and followed him about as\n",
      "he pursued his various avocations. he would wait for him at the side\n",
      "door of the church, for the minor canon held services every day,\n",
      "morning and evening, though nobody came now. \"if any one should come,\"\n",
      "he said to himself, \"i must be found at my post.\" when the young man\n",
      "came out, the griffin would accompany him in his visits to the sick\n",
      "and the poor, and would often look into the windows of the schoolhouse\n",
      "where the minor canon was teaching his unruly scholars. all the other\n",
      "schools were closed, but the parents of the minor canon's scholars\n",
      "forced them to go to school, because they were so bad they could not\n",
      "endure them all day at home,--griffin or no griffin. but it must be\n",
      "said they generally behaved very well when that great monster sat up\n",
      "on his tail and looked in at the schoolroom window.\n",
      "\n",
      "when it was perceived that the griffin showed no signs of going away,\n",
      "all the people who were able to do so left the town. the canons and\n",
      "the higher officers of the church had fled away during the first day\n",
      "of the griffin's visit, leaving behind only the minor canon and some\n",
      "of the men who opened the doors and swept the church. all the citizens\n",
      "who could afford it shut up their houses and travelled to distant\n",
      "parts, and only the working people and the poor were left behind.\n",
      "after some days these ventured to go about and attend to their\n",
      "business, for if they did not work they would starve. they were\n",
      "getting a little used to seeing the griffin, and having been told that\n",
      "he did not eat between equinoxes, they did not feel so much afraid of\n",
      "him as before. day by day the griffin became more and more attached to\n",
      "the minor canon. he kept near him a great part of the time, and often\n",
      "spent the night in front of the little house where the young clergyman\n",
      "lived alone. this strange companionship was often burdensome to the\n",
      "minor canon; but, on the other hand, he could not deny that he derived\n",
      "a great deal of benefit and instruction from it. the griffin had lived\n",
      "for hundreds of years, and had seen much; and he told the minor canon\n",
      "many wonderful things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is like reading an old book,\" said the young clergyman to himself;\n",
      "\"but how many books i would have had to read before i would have found\n",
      "out what the griffin has told me about the earth, the air, the water,\n",
      "about minerals, and metals, and growing things, and all the wonders of\n",
      "the world!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "thus the summer went on, and drew toward its close. and now the people\n",
      "of the town began to be very much troubled again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it will not be long,\" they said, \"before the autumnal equinox is\n",
      "here, and then that monster will want to eat. he will be dreadfully\n",
      "hungry, for he has taken so much exercise since his last meal. he will\n",
      "devour our children. without doubt, he will eat them all. what is to\n",
      "be done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "to this question no one could give an answer, but all agreed that the\n",
      "griffin must not be allowed to remain until the approaching equinox.\n",
      "after talking over the matter a great deal, a crowd of the people went\n",
      "to the minor canon, at a time when the griffin was not with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is all your fault,\" they said, \"that that monster is among us. you\n",
      "brought him here, and you ought to see that he goes away. it is only\n",
      "on your account that he stays here at all, for, although he visits his\n",
      "image every day, he is with you the greater part of the time. if you\n",
      "were not here, he would not stay. it is your duty to go away and then\n",
      "he will follow you, and we shall be free from the dreadful danger\n",
      "which hangs over us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"go away!\" cried the minor canon, greatly grieved at being spoken to\n",
      "in such a way. \"where shall i go? if i go to some other town, shall i\n",
      "not take this trouble there? have i a right to do that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no,\" said the people, \"you must not go to any other town. there is no\n",
      "town far enough away. you must go to the dreadful wilds where the\n",
      "griffin lives; and then he will follow you and stay there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "they did not say whether or not they expected the minor canon to stay\n",
      "there also, and he did not ask them any thing about it. he bowed his\n",
      "head, and went into his house, to think. the more he thought, the more\n",
      "clear it became to his mind that it was his duty to go away, and thus\n",
      "free the town from the presence of the griffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "that evening he packed a leathern bag full of bread and meat, and\n",
      "early the next morning he set out on his journey to the dreadful\n",
      "wilds. it was a long, weary, and doleful journey, especially after he\n",
      "had gone beyond the habitations of men, but the minor canon kept on\n",
      "bravely, and never faltered. the way was longer than he had expected,\n",
      "and his provisions soon grew so scanty that he was obliged to eat but\n",
      "a little every day, but he kept up his courage, and pressed on, and,\n",
      "after many days of toilsome travel, he reached the dreadful wilds.\n",
      "\n",
      "when the griffin found that the minor canon had left the town he\n",
      "seemed sorry, but showed no disposition to go and look for him. after\n",
      "a few days had passed, he became much annoyed, and asked some of the\n",
      "people where the minor canon had gone. but, although the citizens had\n",
      "been anxious that the young clergyman should go to the dreadful wilds,\n",
      "thinking that the griffin would immediately follow him, they were now\n",
      "afraid to mention the minor canon's destination, for the monster\n",
      "seemed angry already, and, if he should suspect their trick, he would\n",
      "doubtless become very much enraged. so every one said he did not know,\n",
      "and the griffin wandered about disconsolate. one morning he looked\n",
      "into the minor canon's schoolhouse, which was always empty now, and\n",
      "thought that it was a shame that every thing should suffer on account\n",
      "of the young man's absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it does not matter so much about the church,\" he said, \"for nobody\n",
      "went there; but it is a pity about the school. i think i will teach it\n",
      "myself until he returns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "it was the hour for opening the school, and the griffin went inside\n",
      "and pulled the rope which rang the schoolbell. some of the children\n",
      "who heard the bell ran in to see what was the matter, supposing it to\n",
      "be a joke of one of their companions; but when they saw the griffin\n",
      "they stood astonished, and scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"go tell the other scholars,\" said the monster, \"that school is about\n",
      "to open, and that if they are not all here in ten minutes, i shall\n",
      "come after them.\" in seven minutes every scholar was in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "never was seen such an orderly school. not a boy or girl moved, or\n",
      "uttered a whisper. the griffin climbed into the master's seat, his\n",
      "wide wings spread on each side of him, because he could not lean back\n",
      "in his chair while they stuck out behind, and his great tail coiled\n",
      "around, in front of the desk, the barbed end sticking up, ready to tap\n",
      "any boy or girl who might misbehave. the griffin now addressed the\n",
      "scholars, telling them that he intended to teach them while their\n",
      "master was away. in speaking he endeavored to imitate, as far as\n",
      "possible, the mild and gentle tones of the minor canon, but it must be\n",
      "admitted that in this he was not very successful. he had paid a good\n",
      "deal of attention to the studies of the school, and he determined not\n",
      "to attempt to teach them anything new, but to review them in what they\n",
      "had been studying; so he called up the various classes, and questioned\n",
      "them upon their previous lessons. the children racked their brains to\n",
      "remember what they had learned. they were so afraid of the griffin's\n",
      "displeasure that they recited as they had never recited before. one of\n",
      "the boys far down in his class answered so well that the griffin was\n",
      "astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i should think you would be at the head,\" said he. \"i am sure you\n",
      "have never been in the habit of reciting so well. why is this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"because i did not choose to take the trouble,\" said the boy,\n",
      "trembling in his boots. he felt obliged to speak the truth, for all\n",
      "the children thought that the great eyes of the griffin could see\n",
      "right through them, and that he would know when they told a falsehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said the griffin. \"go down to\n",
      "the very tail of the class, and if you are not at the head in two\n",
      "days, i shall know the reason why.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the next afternoon the boy was number one.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was astonishing how much these children now learned of what they\n",
      "had been studying. it was as if they had been educated over again. the\n",
      "griffin used no severity toward them, but there was a look about him\n",
      "which made them unwilling to go to bed until they were sure they knew\n",
      "their lessons for the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "the griffin now thought that he ought to visit the sick and the poor;\n",
      "and he began to go about the town for this purpose. the effect upon\n",
      "the sick was miraculous. all, except those who were very ill indeed,\n",

      "nothing else but how he might benefit you and make you happy; and as\n",
      "soon as you imagine yourselves threatened with a danger,--for well i\n",
      "know you are dreadfully afraid of me,--you send him off, caring not\n",
      "whether he returns or perishes, hoping thereby to save yourselves.\n",
      "now, i had conceived a great liking for that young man, and had\n",
      "intended, in a day or two, to go and look him up. but i have changed\n",
      "my mind about him. i shall go and find him, but i shall send him back\n",
      "here to live among you, and i intend that he shall enjoy the reward of\n",
      "his labor and his sacrifices. go, some of you, to the officers of the\n",
      "church, who so cowardly ran away when i first came here, and tell them\n",
      "never to return to this town under penalty of death. and if, when your\n",
      "minor canon comes back to you, you do not bow yourselves before him,\n",
      "put him in the highest place among you, and serve and honor him all\n",
      "his life, beware of my terrible vengeance! there were only two good\n",
      "things in this town: the minor canon and the stone image of myself\n",
      "over your church-door. one of these you have sent away, and the other\n",
      "i shall carry away myself.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the next morning, the griffin came to the church, and tearing the\n",
      "stone image of himself from its fastenings over the great door, he\n",
      "grasped it with his powerful fore-legs and flew up into the air. then,\n",
      "after hovering over the town for a moment, he gave his tail an angry\n",
      "shake and took up his flight to the dreadful wilds. when he reached\n",
      "this desolate region, he set the stone griffin upon a ledge of a rock\n",
      "which rose in front of the dismal cave he called his home. there the\n",
      "image occupied a position somewhat similar to that it had had over the\n",
      "church-door; and the griffin, panting with the exertion of carrying\n",
      "such an enormous load to so great a distance, lay down upon the\n",
      "ground, and regarded it with much satisfaction. when he felt somewhat\n",
      "rested he went to look for the minor canon. he found the young man,\n",
      "weak and half-starved, lying under the shadow of a rock. after picking\n",
      "him up and carrying him to his cave, the griffin flew away to a\n",
      "distant marsh, where he procured some roots and herbs which he well\n",
      "knew were strengthening and beneficial to man, though he had never\n",
      "tasted them himself. after eating these the minor canon was greatly\n",
      "revived, and sat up and listened while the griffin told him what had\n",
      "happened in the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"do you know,\" said the monster, when he had finished, \"that i have\n",

      "\"i am not at all sure that you would be,\" said the griffin, \"if you\n",

      "otherwise. i have been so enraged by discovering the manner in which\n",
      "you have been treated that i have determined that you shall at last\n",
      "enjoy the rewards and honors to which you are entitled. lie down and\n",
      "have a good sleep, and then i will take you back to the town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "as he heard these words, a look of trouble came over the young man's\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you need not give yourself any anxiety,\" said the griffin, \"about my\n",

      "putting the young man gently on the grass in the little field where he\n",
      "himself used to rest, the monster, without having been seen by any of\n",
      "the people, flew back to his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "when the minor canon made his appearance in the morning among the\n",

      "by one of the vanished high officers of the place, and every one was\n",
      "anxious to do all that could be done for his health and comfort. the\n",

      "to the best seats, which they had always been in the habit of taking;\n",
      "and the parents of the bad children determined to reform them at home,\n",
      "in order that he might be spared the trouble of keeping up his former\n",

      "\n",
      "during the first years after his return from the dreadful wilds, the\n",

      "cunning, he was quite capable of doing the thing with which he was\n",
      "charged, and even of boasting of it as a shrewd trick. he had a\n",
      "confused idea that his innocence was impossible to establish, his\n",

      "when thirteen years of age maupassant attended the seminary at yvetot,\n",

      "novels, sixteen volumes of short-stories, three volumes of travels,\n",
      "and many newspaper articles. this gigantic task was performed only\n",
      "because of his regular habits and splendid physique. he wrote\n",
      "regularly every morning from seven o'clock until noon, and at night\n",

      "write for art's sake. in fact he avoided talking on the subject of\n",
      "writing and to all appearances seemed to despise his profession. he\n",
      "wrote because the restless, immitigable force within him compelled him\n",
      "to work like a slave. he thought little of morals, or religion, but\n",
      "was enamored with physical life and its insolvable problems. he was,\n",

      "\"oh, my god!\" said the man in the chair, and every soul in the mess\n",

      "in a fight against overwhelming curiosity. he picked up his team with\n",

      "\n",
      "\"white--white all over,\" said basset-holmer, the adjutant. \"what a\n",

      "\n",
      "the colonel shook the man gently by the arm, and \"who are you?\" said\n",
      "he.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was no answer. the man stared round the mess room and smiled in\n",
      "the colonel's face. little mildred, who was always more of a woman\n",
      "than a man till \"boot and saddle\" was sounded, repeated the question\n",
      "in a voice that would have drawn confidences from a geyser. the man\n",
      "only smiled. dirkovitch, at the far end of the table, slid gently from\n",
      "his chair to the floor, no son of adam, in this present imperfect\n",
      "world, can mix the hussars' champagne with the hussars' brandy by five\n",
      "and eight glasses of each without remembering the pit whence he has\n",
      "been digged and descending thither. the band began to play the tune\n",
      "with which the white hussars, from the date of their formation,\n",
      "preface all their functions. they would sooner be disbanded than\n",
      "abandon that tune. it is a part of their system. the man straightened\n",
      "himself in his chair and drummed on the table with his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i don't see why we should entertain lunatics,\" said the colonel;\n",
      "\"call a guard and send him off to the cells. we'll look into the\n",
      "business in the morning. give him a glass of wine first, though.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "little mildred filled a sherry glass with the brandy and thrust it\n",
      "over to the man. he drank, and the tune rose louder, and he\n",
      "straightened himself yet more. then he put out his long-taloned hands\n",
      "to a piece of plate opposite and fingered it lovingly. there was a\n",
      "mystery connected with that piece of plate in the shape of a spring,\n",
      "which converted what was a seven-branched candlestick, three springs\n",
      "each side and one on the middle, into a sort of wheel-spoke\n",
      "candelabrum[16]. he found the spring, pressed it, and laughed weakly.\n",
      "he rose from his chair and inspected a picture on the wall, then moved\n",
      "on to another picture, the mess watching him without a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "when he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head and seemed\n",
      "distressed. a piece of plate representing a mounted hussar in full\n",
      "uniform caught his eye. he pointed to it, and then to the mantelpiece,\n",
      "with inquiry in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what is it--oh, what is it?\" said little mildred. then, as a mother\n",
      "might speak to a child, \"that is a horse--yes, a horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "very slowly came the answer, in a thick, passionless guttural: \"yes,\n",
      "i--have seen. but--where is _the_ horse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "you could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew\n",
      "back to give the stranger full room in his wanderings. there was no\n",
      "question of calling the guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "again he spoke, very slowly, \"where is _our_ horse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "there is no saying what happened after that. there is but one horse in\n",
      "the white hussars, and his portrait hangs outside the door of the mess\n",
      "room. he is the piebald drum-horse the king of the regimental band,\n",
      "that served the regiment for seven-and-thirty years, and in the end\n",
      "was shot for old age. half the mess tore the thing down from its place\n",
      "and thrust it into the man's hands. he placed it above the\n",
      "mantelpiece; it clattered on the ledge, as his poor hands dropped it,\n",
      "and he staggered toward the bottom of the table, falling into\n",
      "mildred's chair. the band began to play the \"river of years\" waltz,\n",
      "and the laughter from the gardens came into the tobacco-scented mess\n",
      "room. but nobody, even the youngest, was thinking of waltzes. they all\n",
      "spoke to one another something after this fashion: \"the drum-horse\n",
      "hasn't hung over the mantelpiece since '67.\" \"how does he know?\"\n",
      "\"mildred, go and speak to him again.\" \"colonel, what are you going to\n",
      "do?\" \"oh, dry up, and give the poor devil a chance to pull himself\n",
      "together!\" \"it isn't possible, anyhow. the man's a lunatic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "little mildred stood at the colonel's side talking into his ear. \"will\n",
      "you be good enough to take your seats, please, gentlemen?\" he said,\n",
      "and the mess dropped into the chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "only dirkovitch's seat, next to little mildred's, was blank, and\n",
      "little mildred himself had found hira singh's place. the wide-eyed\n",
      "mess sergeant filled the glasses in dead silence. once more the\n",
      "colonel rose, but his hand shook, and the port spilled on the table as\n",
      "he looked straight at the man in little mildred's chair and said,\n",
      "hoarsely, \"mr. vice, the queen.\" there was a little pause, but the man\n",
      "sprang to his feet and answered, without hesitation, \"the queen, god\n",
      "bless her!\" and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank\n",
      "between his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "long and long ago, when the empress of india was a young woman, and\n",
      "there were no unclean ideals in the land, it was the custom in a few\n",
      "messes to drink the queen's toast in broken glass, to the huge delight\n",
      "of the mess contractors. the custom is now dead, because there is\n",
      "nothing to break anything for, except now and again the word of a\n",
      "government, and that has been broken already.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that settles it,\" said the colonel, with a gasp. \"he's not a\n",
      "sergeant. what in the world is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the entire mess echoed the word, and the volley of questions would\n",
      "have scared any man. small wonder that the ragged, filthy invader\n",
      "could only smile and shake his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "from under the table, calm and smiling urbanely[17], rose dirkovitch,\n",
      "who had been roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body. by\n",
      "the side of the man he rose, and the man shrieked and groveled at his\n",
      "feet. it was a horrible sight, coming so swiftly upon the pride and\n",
      "glory of the toast that had brought the strayed wits together.\n",
      "\n",
      "dirkovitch made no offer to raise him, but little mildred heaved him\n",
      "up in an instant. it is not good that a gentleman who can answer to\n",
      "the queen's toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of cossacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "the hasty action tore the wretch's upper clothing nearly to the waist,\n",
      "and his body was seamed with dry black scars. there is only one weapon\n",
      "in the world that cuts in parallel lines, and it is neither the cane\n",
      "nor the cat. dirkovitch saw the marks, and the pupils of his eyes\n",
      "dilated--also, his face changed. he said something that sounded like\n",
      "\"shto ve takete\"; and the man, fawning, answered, \"chetyre.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what's that?\" said everybody together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"his number. that is number four, you know.\" dirkovitch spoke very\n",
      "thickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what has a queen's officer to do with a qualified number?\" said the\n",
      "colonel, and there rose an unpleasant growl round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how can i tell?\" said the affable oriental, with a sweet smile. \"he\n",
      "is a--how you have it?--escape--runaway, from over there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he nodded toward the darkness of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"speak to him, if he'll answer you, and speak to him gently,\" said\n",
      "little mildred, settling the man in a chair. it seemed most improper\n",
      "to all present that dirkovitch. should sip brandy as he talked in\n",
      "purring, spitting russian to the creature who answered so feebly and\n",
      "with such evident dread. but since dirkovitch appeared to understand,\n",
      "no man said a word. they breathed heavily, leaning forward, in the\n",
      "long gaps of the conversation. the next time that they have no\n",
      "engagements on hand the white hussars intend to go to st. petersburg\n",
      "and learn russian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he does not know how many years ago,\" said dirkovitch, facing the\n",
      "mess, \"but he says it was very long ago, in a war, i think that there\n",
      "was an accident. he says he was of this glorious and distinguished\n",
      "regiment in the war.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the rolls! the rolls! holmer, get the rolls!\" said little mildred,\n",
      "and the adjutant dashed off bareheaded to the orderly room where the\n",
      "rolls of the regiment were kept. he returned just in time to hear\n",
      "dirkovitch conclude, \"therefore i am most sorry to say there was an\n",
      "accident, which would have been, reparable if he had apologized to our\n",
      "colonel, whom he had insulted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "another growl, which the colonel tried to beat down. the mess was in\n",
      "no mood to weigh insults to russian colonels just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he does not remember, but i think that there was an accident, and so\n",
      "he was not exchanged among the prisoners, but he was sent to another\n",
      "place--how do you say?--the country. _so_, he says, he came here. he\n",
      "does not know how he came. eh? he _was_ at chepany[18]\"--the man\n",
      "caught the word, nodded, and shivered--\"at zhigansk[19] and\n",
      "irkutsk[20]. i cannot understand how he escaped. he says, too, that he\n",
      "was in the forests for many years, but how many years he has\n",
      "forgotten--that with many things. it was an accident; done because he\n",
      "did not apologise to our colonel. ah!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of echoing dirkovitch's sigh of regret, it is sad to record\n",
      "that the white hussars livelily exhibited unchristian delight and\n",
      "other emotions, hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality.\n",
      "holmer flung the frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table, and\n",
      "the men flung themselves atop of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"steady! fifty-six--fifty-five--fifty-four,\" said holmer. \"here we\n",
      "are. 'lieutenant austin limmason--_missing_.' that was before\n",
      "sebastopol[21]. what an infernal shame! insulted one of their\n",
      "colonels, and was quietly shipped off. thirty years of his life wiped\n",
      "out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but he never apologized. said he'd see him----first,\" chorussed the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"poor devil! i suppose he never had the chance afterward. how did he\n",

      "\n",
      "swift as a shot came the answer, in a slightly surprised tone, \"yes,\n",
      "i'm limmason, of course.\" the light died out in his eyes, and he\n",
      "collapsed afresh, watching every motion of dirkovitch with terror. a\n",
      "flight from siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind, but it\n",
      "does not lead to continuity of thought. the man could not explain how,\n",
      "like a homing pigeon, he had found his way to his own old mess again.\n",
      "of what he had suffered or seen he knew nothing. he cringed before\n",
      "dirkovitch as instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the\n",
      "candlestick, sought the picture of the drum-horse, and answered to the\n",
      "queen's toast. the rest was a blank that the dreaded russian tongue\n",
      "could only in part remove. his head bowed on his breast, and he\n",
      "giggled and cowered alternately.\n",
      "\n",
      "the devil that lived in the brandy prompted dirkovitch at this\n",
      "extremely inopportune moment to make a speech. he rose, swaying\n",
      "slightly, gripped the table edge, while his eyes glowed like opals,\n",
      "and began:--\"fellow-soldiers glorious--true friends and hospitables.\n",
      "it was an accident, and deplorable--most deplorable.\" here he smiled\n",
      "sweetly all round the mess. \"but you will think of this little, little\n",
      "thing. so little, is it not? the czar! posh! i slap my fingers--i snap\n",
      "my fingers at him. do i believe in him? no! but the slav who has done\n",
      "nothing, _him_ i believe. seventy--how much?--millions that have done\n",
      "nothing--not one thing. napoleon was an episode.\" he banged a hand on\n",
      "the table. \"hear you, old peoples, we have done nothing in the\n",
      "world--out here. all our work is to do: and it shall be done, old\n",
      "peoples. get away!\" he waved his hand imperiously, and pointed to the\n",
      "man. \"you see him. he is not good to see. he was just one little--oh,\n",
      "so little--accident, that no one remembered. now he is _that_. so will\n",
      "you be, brother-soldiers so brave--so will you be. but you will never\n",
      "come back. you will all go where he has gone, or\"--he pointed to the\n",
      "great coffin shadow on the ceiling, and muttering, \"seventy\n",
      "millions--get away, you old people,\" fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"sweet, and to the point,\" said little mildred. \"what's the use of\n",
      "getting wroth? let's make the poor devil comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "but that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands\n",
      "of the white hussars. the lieutenant had returned only to go away\n",
      "again three days later, when the wail of the \"dead march\" and the\n",
      "tramp of the squadrons told the wondering station, that saw no gap in\n",
      "the table, an officer of the regiment had resigned his new-found\n",
      "commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "and dirkovitch--bland, supple, and always genial--went away too by a\n",
      "night train. little mildred and another saw him off, for he was the\n",
      "guest of the mess, and even had he smitten the colonel with the open\n",
      "hand the law of the mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good-by, dirkovitch, and a pleasant journey,\" said little mildred.\n",

      "with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely\n",

      "weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden,\n",

      "terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight. he\n",
      "suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses. the most insipid\n",
      "food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain\n",
      "texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were\n",
      "tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds,\n",

      "ventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force\n",

      "which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family\n",

      "which i had ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the\n",
      "wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its\n",

      "around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\n",

      "the change in my thoughts, i felt no longer any great aversion from\n",
      "the labor imposed, i had become most unaccountably interested--nay,\n",
      "even excited. perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant\n",
      "demeanor of legrand--some air of forethought, or of deliberation,\n",
      "which impressed me. i dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself\n",
      "actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation,\n",
      "for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my\n",
      "unfortunate companion. at a period when such vagaries of thought most\n",
      "fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a\n",
      "half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog.\n",
      "his uneasiness in the first instance had been, evidently, but the\n",
      "result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and\n",
      "serious tone. upon jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made\n",
      "furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould\n",
      "frantically with his claws. in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass\n",
      "of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with\n",
      "several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed\n",
      "woolen. one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large\n",
      "spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four pieces of gold\n",
      "and silver coin came to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but\n",
      "the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment.\n",
      "he urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were\n",
      "hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe\n",
      "of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose\n",
      "earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "we now worked in earnest, and never did i pass ten minutes of more\n",
      "intense excitement. during this interval we had fairly unearthed an\n",
      "oblong chest of wood which, from its perfect preservation and\n",
      "wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\n",
      "process--perhaps that of the bichloride of mercury. this box was three\n",
      "feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep.\n",
      "it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a\n",
      "kind of trellis-work over the whole. on each side of the chest, near\n",
      "the top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a\n",
      "firm hold could be obtained by six persons. our utmost united\n",
      "endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed.\n",
      "we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.\n",
      "luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding\n",
      "bolts. these we drew back--trembling and panting with anxiety. in an\n",
      "instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. as\n",
      "the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a\n",
      "glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, that\n",
      "absolutely dazzled our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed.\n",
      "amazement was, of course, predominant. legrand appeared exhausted with\n",
      "excitement, and spoke very few words. jupiter's countenance wore, for\n",
      "some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of\n",
      "things, for any negro's visage to assume. he seemed\n",
      "stupefied---thunder-stricken. presently he fell upon his knees in the\n",
      "pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them\n",
      "there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. at length, with a\n",
      "deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug! de poor little\n",
      "goole-bug, what i 'boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! ain't you\n",
      "'shamed ofa yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "it became necessary, at last, that i should arouse both master and\n",
      "valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. it was growing late,\n",
      "and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get everything\n",
      "housed before daylight. it was difficult to say what should be done,\n",
      "and much time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of\n",
      "all. we, finally, lightened the box by removing two-thirds of its\n",
      "contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from\n",
      "the hole. the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles,\n",
      "and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from jupiter\n",
      "neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his\n",
      "mouth until our return. we then hurriedly made for home with the\n",
      "chest, reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one\n",
      "o'clock in the morning. worn out as we were, it was not in human\n",
      "nature to do more just now. we rested until two, and had supper,\n",
      "starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout\n",
      "sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises. a little before\n",
      "four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty as\n",
      "equally as might be among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again\n",
      "set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our\n",
      "golden burdens, just as the first streaks of dawn gleamed from over\n",
      "the treetops in the east.\n",
      "\n",
      "we were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the\n",
      "time denied us repose. after an unquiet slumber of some three or four\n",
      "hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of\n",
      "our treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "the chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and\n",
      "the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents.\n",
      "there had been nothing like order or arrangement. everything had been\n",
      "heaped in promiscuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even\n",
      "vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. in coin there was rather\n",
      "more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars--estimating the\n",
      "value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the\n",
      "period. there was not a particle of silver. all was gold of antique\n",
      "date and of great variety--french, spanish, and german money, with a\n",
      "few english guineas, and some counters[14] of which we had never seen\n",
      "specimens before. there were several very large and heavy coins, so\n",
      "worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. there was no\n",
      "american money. the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in\n",
      "estimating. there were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and\n",
      "fine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen\n",
      "rubies of remarkable brilliancy; three hundred and ten emeralds, all\n",
      "very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. these stones\n",
      "had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest.\n",
      "the settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other\n",
      "gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent\n",
      "indentification. besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\n",
      "gold ornaments--nearly two hundred massive finger and ear rings; rich\n",
      "chains--thirty of these, if i remember; eighty-three very large and\n",
      "heavy crucifixes; five gold censers of great value; a prodigious\n",
      "golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\n",
      "bacchanalian[15] figures; with two sword handles exquisitely embossed,\n",
      "and many other smaller articles which i cannot recollect. the weight\n",
      "of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds\n",
      "avoirdupois; and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and\n",
      "ninety-seven superb gold watches, three of the number being worth each\n",
      "five hundred dollars, if one. many of them were very old, and as\n",
      "time-keepers valueless, the works having suffered, more or less, from\n",
      "corrosion; but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth.\n",
      "we estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a\n",
      "million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of\n",
      "the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was\n",

      "\n",
      "when, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense\n",
      "excitement of the time had in some measure subsided, legrand, who saw\n",
      "that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most\n",
      "extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the\n",
      "circumstances connected with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you remember,\" said he, \"the night when i handed you the rough sketch\n",
      "i had made of the _scarabaeus_. you recollect, also, that i became\n",
      "quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a\n",
      "death's-head. when you first made this assertion i thought you were\n",
      "jesting; but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the\n",
      "back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some,\n",
      "little foundation in fact. still, the sneer at my graphic powers\n",
      "irritated me--for i am considered a good artist--and, therefore, when\n",
      "you handed me the scrap of parchment, i was about to crumple it up and\n",
      "throw it angrily into the fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the scrap of paper, you mean,\" said i.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first i supposed\n",
      "it to be such, but when i came to draw upon it, i discovered it at\n",
      "once to be a piece of very thin parchment. it was quite dirty, you\n",
      "remember. well, as i was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance\n",
      "fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may\n",
      "imagine my astonishment when i perceived, in fact, the figure of a\n",
      "death's-head just where, it seemed to me, i had made the drawing of\n",
      "the beetle. for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy.\n",
      "i knew that my design was very different in detail from this, although\n",
      "there was a certain similarity in general outline. presently i took a\n",
      "candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to\n",
      "scrutinize the parchment more closely. upon turning it over, i saw my\n",
      "own sketch upon, the reverse, just as i had made it. my first idea,\n",
      "now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of\n",
      "outline--at the singular coincidence involved in the fact that,\n",
      "unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of\n",
      "the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the _scarabaeus_, and\n",
      "that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely\n",
      "resemble my drawing. i say the singularity of this coincidence\n",
      "absolutely stupefied me for a time. this is the usual effect of such\n",
      "coincidences. the mind struggles to establish a connection--a sequence\n",
      "of cause and effect--and being unable to do so, suffers a species of\n",
      "temporary paralysis. but when i recovered from this stupor, there\n",
      "dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more\n",
      "than the coincidence. i began distinctly, positively, to remember that\n",
      "there had been _no_ drawing upon the parchment when i made my sketch\n",
      "of the _scarabaeus_. i became perfectly certain of this; for i\n",
      "recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of\n",
      "the cleanest spot. had the skull been then there, of course, i could\n",
      "not have failed to notice it. here was indeed a mystery which i felt\n",
      "it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed\n",
      "to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my\n",
      "intellect, a glowworm-like conception of that truth which last night's\n",
      "adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. i arose at once,\n",
      "and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all further\n",
      "reflection until i should be alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"when you had gone, and when jupiter was fast asleep, i betook myself\n",
      "to a more methodical investigation of the affair. in the first place i\n",
      "considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\n",
      "possession. the spot where we discovered the _scarabaeus_ was on the\n",
      "coast of the mainland, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a\n",
      "short distance above high water mark. upon my taking hold of it, it\n",
      "gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. jupiter, with\n",
      "his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\n",
      "towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature,\n",
      "by which to take hold of it. it was at this moment that his eyes, and\n",
      "mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which i then supposed to\n",
      "be paper. it was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up.\n",
      "near the spot where we found it, i observed the remnants of the hull\n",
      "of what appeared to have been a ship's long-boat. the wreck seemed to\n",
      "have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat\n",
      "timbers could scarcely be traced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and\n",
      "gave it to me. soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way\n",
      "met lieutenant g----. i showed him the insect, and he begged me to let\n",
      "him take it to the fort. upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\n",
      "into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been\n",
      "wrapped, and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his\n",
      "inspection. perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it\n",
      "best to make sure of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he\n",
      "is on all subjects connected with natural history. at the same time,\n",
      "without being conscious of it, i must have deposited the parchment in\n",
      "my own pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you remember that when i went to the table, for the purpose of making\n",
      "a sketch of the beetle, i found no paper where it was usually kept, i\n",
      "looked in the drawer, and found none there. i searched my pockets,\n",
      "hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. i\n",

      "the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no doubt you will think me fanciful, but i had already established a\n",
      "kind of _connection_. i had put together two links of a great chain.\n",
      "there was a boat lying upon a seacoast, and not far from the boat was\n",
      "a parchment--_not a paper_--with a skull depicted upon it. you will,\n",
      "of course, ask, 'where is the connection?' i reply that the skull, or\n",
      "death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. the flag of the\n",
      "death's-head is hoisted in all engagements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. parchment is\n",
      "durable--almost imperishable. matters of little moment are rarely\n",
      "consigned to parchment, since, for the mere ordinary purposes of\n",
      "drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. this\n",
      "reflection suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the\n",
      "death's-head. i did not fail to observe, also, the _form_ of the\n",
      "parchment. although one of its corners had been, by some accident,\n",
      "destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong. it was\n",
      "just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a\n",
      "memorandum--for a record of something to be long remembered and\n",
      "carefully preserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but,\" i interposed, \"you say that the skull was _not_ upon the\n",
      "parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle. how, then, do you\n",
      "trace any connection between the boat and the skull--since this\n",
      "latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (god\n",
      "only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching\n",

      "\n",
      "\"ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this\n",
      "point, i had comparatively little difficulty in solving. my steps were\n",
      "sure, and could afford but a single result. i reasoned, for example,\n",
      "thus: when i drew the _scarabaeus_, there was no skull apparent upon\n",
      "the parchment. when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you, and\n",
      "observed you narrowly until you returned it, _you_, therefore, did not\n",
      "design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. then it was\n",
      "not done by human agency. and nevertheless it was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember, and _did_\n",
      "remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred\n",
      "about the period in question. the weather was chilly (oh, rare and\n",
      "happy accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. i was heated\n",
      "with exercise, and sat near the table. you, however, had drawn a chair\n",
      "close to the chimney. just as i placed the parchment in your hand, and\n",
      "as you were in the act of inspecting it, wolf, the newfoundland,\n",
      "entered, and leaped upon your shoulders. with, your left hand you\n",
      "caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the\n",
      "parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in\n",
      "close proximity to the fire. at one moment i thought the blaze had\n",
      "caught it, and was about to caution you, but before i could speak you\n",
      "had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. when i\n",
      "considered all these particulars, i doubted not for a moment that\n",
      "_heat_ had been the agent in bringing to light, upon the parchment,\n",
      "the skull which i saw designed upon it. you are well aware that\n",
      "chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by\n",
      "means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum, so\n",
      "that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the\n",
      "action of fire. zaffre[16], digested in _aqua regia_[17], and diluted\n",
      "with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green\n",
      "tint results. the regulus[18] of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre,\n",
      "gives a red. these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals\n",
      "after the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon\n",
      "the re-application of heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i now scrutinized the death's-head with care. its outer edges--the\n",
      "edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more\n",
      "_distinct_ than the others. it was clear that the action of the\n",
      "caloric had been imperfect or unequal. i immediately kindled a fire,\n",
      "and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. at\n",
      "first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the\n",
      "skull; but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible,\n",
      "at the corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\n",
      "death's-head was delineated, the figure of what i at first supposed to\n",
      "be a goat. a closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was\n",

      "\n",
      "\"ha! ha!\" said i; \"to be sure i have no right to laugh at you--a\n",

      "sooner or later stumble--that our great creative mother, while she\n",
      "amuses us with apparently working in the broadest sunshine, is yet\n",
      "severely careful to keep her own secrets, and, in spite of her\n",
      "pretended openness, shows us nothing but results. she permits us,\n",
      "indeed, to mar, but seldom to mend, and, like a jealous patentee, on\n",
      "no account to make. now, however, aylmer resumed these half-forgotten\n",
      "investigations; not, of course, with such hopes or wishes as first\n",
      "suggested them; but because they involved much physiological truth and\n",
      "lay in the path of his proposed scheme for the treatment of georgiana.\n",
      "\n",
      "as he led her over the threshold of the laboratory georgiana was cold\n",
      "and tremulous. aylmer looked cheerfully into her face, with intent to\n",
      "reassure her, but was so startled with the intense glow of the\n",
      "birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a\n",
      "strong convulsive shudder. his wife fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"aminadab! aminadab!\" shouted aylmer, stamping violently on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "forthwith there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature,\n",
      "but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was\n",
      "grimed with the vapors of the furnace. this personage had been\n",
      "aylmer's under-worker during his whole scientific career, and was\n",
      "admirably fitted for that office by his great mechanical readiness,\n",
      "and the skill with which, while incapable of comprehending a single\n",
      "principle, he executed all the details of his master's experiments.\n",
      "with his vast strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the\n",
      "indescribable earthiness that incrusted him, he seemed to represent\n",
      "man's physical nature; while aylmer's slender figure, and pale,\n",
      "intellectual face, were no less apt a type of the spiritual element.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"throw open the door of the boudoir, aminadab,\" said aylmer, \"and burn\n",
      "a pastil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes, master,\" answered aminadab, looking intently at the lifeless\n",
      "form of georgiana; and then he muttered to himself, \"if she were my\n",
      "wife, i'd never part with that birthmark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "when georgiana recovered consciousness she found herself breathing an\n",
      "atmosphere of penetrating fragrance, the gentle potency of which had\n",
      "recalled her from her deathlike faintness. the scene around her looked\n",
      "like enchantment. aylmer had converted those smoky, dingy, sombre\n",
      "rooms, where he had spent his brightest years in recondite[4]\n",
      "pursuits, into a series of beautiful apartments not unfit to be the\n",
      "secluded abode of a lovely woman. the walls were hung with gorgeous\n",
      "curtains, which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no\n",
      "other species of adornment can achieve; and, as they fell from the\n",
      "ceiling to the floor, their rich and ponderous folds, concealing all\n",
      "angles and straight lines, appeared to shut in the scene from infinite\n",
      "space. for aught georgiana knew, it might be a pavilion among the\n",
      "clouds. and alymer, excluding the sunshine, which would have\n",
      "interfered with his chemical processes, had supplied its place with\n",
      "perfumed lamps, emitting flames of various hue, but all uniting in a\n",
      "soft, impurpled radiance. he now knelt by his wife's side, watching\n",
      "her earnestly, but without alarm; for he was confident in his science,\n",
      "and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no\n",
      "evil might intrude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"where am i? ah, i remember,\" said georgiana, faintly; and she placed\n",
      "her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husband's\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"fear not, dearest!\" exclaimed he. \"do not shrink from me! believe me,\n",
      "georgiana, i even rejoice in this single imperfection, since it will\n",
      "be such a rapture to remove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"o, spare me!\" sadly replied his wife. \"pray do not look at it again.\n",
      "i never can forget that convulsive shudder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "in order to soothe georgiana, and, as it were, to release her mind\n",
      "from the burden of actual things, aylmer now put in practice some of\n",
      "the light and playful secrets which science had taught him among its\n",
      "profounder lore. airy figures, absolutely bodiless ideas, and forms of\n",
      "unsubstantial beauty came and danced before her, imprinting their\n",
      "momentary footsteps on beams of light. though she had some indistinct\n",
      "idea of the method of these optical phenomena, still the illusion was\n",
      "almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possessed\n",
      "sway over the spiritual world. then again, when she felt a wish to\n",
      "look forth from her seclusion, immediately, as if her thoughts were\n",
      "answered, the procession of external existence flitted across a\n",
      "screen. the scenery and the figures of actual life were perfectly\n",
      "represented, but with that bewitching yet indescribable difference\n",
      "which always makes a picture, an image, or a shadow so much more\n",
      "attractive than the original. when wearied of this, aylmer bade her\n",
      "cast her eyes upon a vessel containing a quantity of earth. she did so\n",
      "with little interest at first; but was soon startled to perceive the\n",
      "germ of a plant shooting upward from the soil: then came the slender\n",
      "stalk; the leaves gradually unfolded themselves; and amid them was a\n",
      "perfect and lovely flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is magical!\" cried georgiana. \"i dare not touch it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"nay, pluck it,\" answered aylmer,--\"pluck it, and inhale its brief\n",
      "perfume while you may. the flower will wither in a few moments and\n",
      "leave nothing save its brown seed-vessels; but thence may be\n",
      "perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "but georgiana had no sooner touched the flower than the whole plant\n",
      "suffered a blight, its leaves turning coal black as if by the agency\n",
      "of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there was too powerful a stimulus,\" said aylmer, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "to make up for this abortive experiment, he proposed to take her\n",
      "portrait by a scientific process of his own invention. it was to be\n",
      "effected by rays of light striking upon a polished plate of metal.\n",
      "georgiana assented; but, on looking at the result, was affrighted to\n",
      "find the features of the portrait blurred and indefinable; while the\n",
      "minute figure of a hand appeared where the cheek should have been.\n",
      "alymer snatched the metallic plate and threw it into a jar of\n",
      "corrosive[5] acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "soon, however, he forgot these mortifying failures. in the intervals\n",
      "of study and chemical experiment he came to her flushed and exhausted,\n",
      "but seemed invigorated by her presence, and spoke in glowing language\n",
      "of the resources of his art. he gave a history of the long dynasty of\n",
      "the alchemists, who spent so many ages in quest of the universal\n",
      "solvent by which the golden principle might be elicited from all\n",
      "things vile and base, aylmer appeared to believe that, by the plainest\n",
      "scientific logic, it was altogether within the limits of possibility\n",
      "to discover this long-sought medium. \"but,\" he added, \"a philosopher\n",
      "who should go deep enough to acquire the power would attain too lofty\n",
      "a wisdom to stoop to the exercise of it.\" not less singular were his\n",
      "opinions in regard to the elixir vitae[6]. he more than intimated that\n",
      "it was at his option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for\n",
      "years, perhaps interminably; but that it would produce a discord in\n",
      "nature which all the world, and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal\n",
      "nostrum, would find cause to curse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"aylmer, are you in earnest?\" asked georgiana, looking at him with\n",
      "amazement and fear. \"it is terrible to possess such power, or even to\n",
      "dream of possessing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"o, do not tremble, my love,\" said her husband. \"i would not wrong\n",
      "either you or myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our\n",
      "lives; but i would have you consider how trifling, in comparison, is\n",
      "the skill requisite to remove this little hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "at the mention of the birthmark, georgiana, as usual, shrank as if a\n",
      "red-hot iron had touched her cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "again aylmer applied himself to his labors. she could hear his voice\n",
      "in the distant furnace-room giving directions to aminadab, whose\n",
      "harsh, uncouth, misshapen tones were audible in response, more like\n",
      "the grunt or growl of a brute than human speech. after hours of\n",
      "absence, aylmer reappeared and proposed that she should now examine\n",
      "his cabinet of chemical products and natural treasures of the earth.\n",
      "among the former he showed her a small vial, in which, he remarked,\n",
      "was contained a gentle yet most powerful fragrance, capable of\n",
      "impregnating all the breezes that blow across a kingdom. they were of\n",
      "inestimable value, the contents of that little vial; and, as he said\n",
      "so, he threw some of the perfume into the air and filled the room with\n",
      "piercing and invigorating delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and what is this?\" asked georgiana, pointing to a small crystal globe\n",
      "containing a gold-colored liquid. \"it is so beautiful to the eye that\n",
      "i could imagine it the elixir of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"in one sense it is,\" replied aylmer; \"or rather, the elixir of\n",
      "immortality. it is the most precious poison that ever was concocted in\n",
      "this world. by its aid i could apportion the lifetime of any mortal at\n",
      "whom you might point your finger. the strength of the dose would\n",
      "determine whether he were to linger out years, or drop dead in the\n",
      "midst of a breath. no king on his guarded throne could keep his life\n",
      "if i, in my private station, should deem that the welfare of millions\n",
      "justified me in depriving him of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why do you keep such a terrific drug?\" inquired georgiana, in horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"do not mistrust me, dearest,\" said her husband, smiling; \"its\n",
      "virtuous potency is yet greater than its harmful one. but see! here is\n",
      "a powerful cosmetic. with a few drops of this in a vase of water,\n",
      "freckles may be washed away as easily as the hands are cleansed. a\n",
      "stronger infusion[7] would take the blood out of the cheek, and leave\n",
      "the rosiest beauty a pale ghost.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"is it with this lotion that you intend to bathe my cheek?\" asked\n",
      "georgiana, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"o no,\" hastily replied her husband; \"this is merely superficial. your\n",
      "case demands a remedy that shall go deeper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "in his interviews with georgiana, aylmer generally made minute\n",
      "inquiries as to her sensations, and whether the confinement of the\n",
      "rooms and the temperature of the atmosphere agreed with her. these\n",
      "questions had such a particular drift that georgiana began to\n",
      "conjecture that she was already subjected to certain physical\n",
      "influences, either breathed in with the fragrant air or taken with her\n",
      "food. she fancied likewise, but it might be altogether fancy, that\n",
      "there was a stirring up of her system,--a strange, indefinite\n",
      "sensation creeping through her veins, and tingling, half painfully,\n",
      "half pleasurably, at her heart. still, whenever she dared to look into\n",
      "the mirror, there she beheld herself pale as a white rose and with the\n",
      "crimson birthmark stamped upon her cheek. not even aylmer now hated it\n",
      "so much as she.\n",
      "\n",
      "to dispel the tedium of the hours which her husband found it necessary\n",
      "to devote to the processes of combination and analysis, georgiana\n",
      "turned over the volumes of his scientific library. in many dark old\n",
      "tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry. they were the\n",
      "works of the philosophers of the middle ages, such as albertus\n",
      "magnus[8], cornelius agrippa[9], paracelsus[10], and the famous friar\n",
      "who created the prophetic brazen head. all these antique naturalists\n",
      "stood in advance of their centuries, yet were imbued with some of\n",
      "their credulity, and therefore were believed, and perhaps imagined\n",
      "themselves to have acquired from the investigation of nature a power\n",
      "above nature, and from physics a sway over the spiritual world. hardly\n",
      "less curious and imaginative were the early volumes of the\n",
      "transactions of the royal society[11], in which the members, knowing\n",
      "little of the limits of natural possibility, were continually\n",
      "recording wonders or proposing methods whereby wonders might be\n",
      "wrought.\n",
      "\n",
      "but, to georgiana, the most engrossing volume was a large folio from\n",
      "her husband's own hand, in which he had recorded every experiment of\n",
      "his scientific career, its original aim, the methods adopted for its\n",
      "development, and its final success or failure, with the circumstances\n",
      "to which either event was attributable. the book, in truth; was both\n",
      "the history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative, yet\n",
      "practical and laborious life. he handled physical details as if there\n",
      "were nothing beyond them; yet spiritualized them all, and redeemed\n",
      "himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards\n",
      "the infinite. in his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul.\n",
      "georgiana, as she read, reverenced aylmer and loved him more\n",
      "profoundly than ever, but with a less entire dependence on his\n",
      "judgment than heretofore. much as he had accomplished, she could not\n",
      "but observe that his most splendid successes were almost invariably\n",
      "failures, if compared with the ideal at which he aimed. his brightest\n",
      "diamonds were the merest pebbles, and felt to be so by himself, in\n",
      "comparison with the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his\n",
      "reach. the volume, rich with achievements that had won renown for its\n",
      "author, was yet as melancholy a record as over mortal hand had penned.\n",
      "it was the sad confession and continual exemplification of the\n",
      "shortcomings of the composite man, the spirit burdened with clay and\n",
      "working in matter, and of the despair that assails the higher nature\n",
      "at finding itself so miserably thwarted by the earthly part. perhaps\n",
      "every man of genius, in whatever sphere, might recognize the image of\n",
      "his own experience in aylmer's journal.\n",
      "\n",
      "so deeply did these reflections affect georgiana that she laid her\n",
      "face upon the open volume and burst into tears. in this situation she\n",
      "was found by her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is dangerous to read in a sorcerer's books,\" said he with a smile,\n",
      "though his countenance was uneasy and displeased. \"georgiana, there\n",
      "are pages in that volume which i can scarcely glance over and keep my\n",
      "senses. take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it has made me worship you more than ever.\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah, wait for this one success,\" rejoined he, \"then worship me if you\n",
      "will. i shall deem myself hardly unworthy of it. but come. i have\n",
      "sought you for the luxury of your voice. sing to me, dearest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "so she poured out the liquid music of her voice to quench the thirst\n",
      "of his spirit. he then took his leave with a boyish exuberance of\n",
      "gayety, assuring her that her seclusion would endure but a little\n",
      "longer, and that the result was already certain. scarcely had he\n",
      "departed when georgiana felt irresistibly impelled to follow him. she\n",
      "had forgotten to inform aylmer of a symptom which for two or three\n",
      "hours past had begun to excite her attention. it was a sensation in\n",
      "the fatal birthmark, not painful, but which induced a restlessness\n",
      "throughout her system. hastening after her husband, she intruded for\n",
      "the first time into the laboratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first thing that struck her eye was the furnace, that hot and\n",
      "feverish worker, with the intense glow of its fire, which by the\n",
      "quantities of soot clustered above it seemed to have been burning for\n",
      "ages. there was a distilling-apparatus in full operation. around the\n",
      "room were retorts, tubes, cylinders, crucibles, and other apparatus of\n",
      "chemical research. an electrical machine stood ready for immediate\n",
      "use. the atmosphere felt oppressively close, and was tainted with\n",
      "gaseous odors which had been tormented forth by the processes of\n",
      "science. the severe and homely simplicity of the apartment, with its\n",
      "naked walls and brick pavement, looked strange, accustomed as\n",
      "georgiana had become to the fantastic elegance of her boudoir. but\n",
      "what chiefly, indeed almost solely, drew her attention, was the aspect\n",
      "of aylmer himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "he was pale as death, anxious and absorbed, and hung over the furnace\n",
      "as if it depended upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid\n",
      "which it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or\n",
      "misery. how different from the sanguine and joyous mien that he had\n",
      "assumed for georgiana's encouragement!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"carefully now, aminadab; carefully, thou human machine; carefully,\n",
      "thou man of clay,\" muttered aylmer, more to himself than his\n",
      "assistant. \"now, if there be a thought too much or too little, it is\n",
      "all over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ho! ho!\" mumbled aminadab. \"look, master! look!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "aylmer raised his eyes hastily, and at first reddened, then grew paler\n",
      "than ever, on beholding georgiana. he rushed towards her and seized\n",
      "her arm with a gripe that left the print of his fingers upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why do you come thither? have you no trust in your husband?\" cried\n",
      "he, impetuously. \"would you throw the blight of that fatal birthmark\n",
      "over my labors? it is not well done. go, prying woman! go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"nay, aylmer,\" said georgiana with the firmness of which she possessed\n",
      "no stinted endowment, \"it is not you that have a right to complain.\n",
      "you mistrust your wife; you have concealed the anxiety with which you\n",
      "watch the development of this experiment. think not so unworthily of\n",
      "me, my husband. tell me all the risk we run, and fear not that i shall\n",
      "shrink: for my share in it is far less than your own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, no, georgiana!\" said aylmer, impatiently; \"it must not be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i submit,\" replied she, calmly. \"and, aylmer, i shall quaff whatever\n",
      "draught you bring me; but it will be on the same principle that would\n",
      "induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my noble wife,\" said aylmer, deeply moved, \"i knew not the height and\n",
      "depth of your nature until now. nothing shall be concealed. know,\n",
      "then, that this crimson hand, superficial as it seems, has clutched\n",
      "its grasp into your being with a strength of which i had no previous\n",
      "conception. i have already administered agents powerful enough to do\n",
      "aught except to change your entire physical system. only one thing\n",
      "remains to be tried. if that fail us we are ruined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why did you hesitate to tell me this?\" asked she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"because, georgiana,\" said aylmer, in a low voice, \"there is danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"danger? there is but one danger,--that this horrible stigma shall be\n",
      "left upon my cheek!\" cried georgiana. \"remove it, remove it, whatever\n",
      "be the cost, or we shall both go mad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"heaven knows your words are too true,\" said aylmer, sadly. \"and now,\n",
      "dearest, return to your boudoir. in a little while all will be\n",
      "tested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness\n",
      "which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake. after\n",
      "his departure georgiana became rapt in musings. she considered the\n",
      "character of aylmer, and did it completer justice than at any previous\n",
      "moment. her heart exulted, while it trembled, at his honorable\n",
      "love,--so pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than\n",
      "perfection, nor miserably make itself contented with an earthlier\n",
      "nature than he had dreamed of. she felt how much more precious was\n",
      "such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the\n",
      "imperfection for her sake, and have been guilty of treason to holy\n",
      "love by degrading its perfect idea to the level of the actual; and\n",
      "with her whole spirit she prayed that, for a single moment, she might\n",
      "satisfy his highest and deepest conception. longer than one moment she\n",
      "well knew it could not be; for his spirit was ever on the march, ever\n",
      "ascending, and each instant required something that was beyond the\n",
      "scope of the instant before.\n",
      "\n",
      "the sound of her husband's footsteps aroused her. he bore a crystal\n",
      "goblet containing a liquor colorless as water, but bright enough to be\n",
      "the draught of immortality. aylmer was pale; but it seemed rather the\n",
      "consequence of a highly wrought state of mind and tension of spirit\n",
      "than of fear or doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the concoction of the draught has been perfect,\" said he, in answer\n",
      "to georgiana's look. \"unless all my science have deceived me, it\n",
      "cannot fail.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"save on your account, my dearest aylmer,\" observed his wife, \"i might\n",

      "was involved in the process now to be tested. mingled with this mood,\n",

      "\n",
      "while thus employed, he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand,\n",

      "the very act; and georgiana, out of the midst of her deep sleep, moved\n",
      "uneasily, and murmured, as if in remonstrance. again aylmer resumed,\n",
      "his watch. nor was it without avail. the crimson hand, which at first\n",
      "had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of georgiana's\n",
      "cheek, now grew more faintly outlined. she remained not less pale than\n",
      "ever; but the birthmark, with every breath that came and went, lost\n",
      "somewhat of its former distinctness. its presence had been awful; its\n",
      "departure was more awful still. watch the stain of the rainbow fading\n",
      "out of the sky, and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"by heaven! it is well-nigh gone!\" said aylmer to himself, in almost\n",
      "irrepressible ecstasy. \"i can scarcely trace it now. success! success!\n",
      "and now it is like the faintest rose color. the lightest flush of\n",
      "blood across her cheek would overcome it. but she is so pale!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he drew aside the window-curtain and suffered the light of natural day\n",
      "to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek. at the same time he\n",
      "heard a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant\n",
      "aminadab's expression of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah, clod! ah, earthly mass!\" cried aylmer, laughing in a sort of\n",

      "heaven--have both done their part in this! laugh, thing of the senses!\n",
      "you have earned the right to laugh.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "these exclamations broke georgiana's sleep. she slowly unclosed her\n",
      "eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that\n",
      "purpose. a faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how\n",
      "barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed\n",
      "forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their\n",
      "happiness. but then her eyes sought aylmer's face with a trouble and\n",
      "anxiety that he could by no means account for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my poor aylmer!\" murmured she.\n",
      "\n",

      "alas! it was too true! the fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of\n",
      "life, and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union\n",
      "with a mortal frame. as the last crimson tint of the birthmark--that\n",
      "sole token of human imperfection--faded from her cheek, the parting\n",
      "breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere, and her\n",

      "hold a chat with the solitary man. it is a lonesome, and, when the\n",
      "character is inclined to thought, may be an intensely thoughtful,\n",
      "occupation; as it proved in the case of ethan brand, who had mused to\n",
      "such strange purpose, in days gone by, while the fire in this very\n",
      "kiln was burning.\n",
      "\n",
      "the man who now watched the fire was of a different order, and\n",
      "troubled himself with no thoughts save the very few that were\n",
      "requisite to his business. at frequent intervals he flung back the\n",
      "clashing weight of the iron door, and, turning his face from the\n",
      "insufferable glare, thrust in huge logs of oak, or stirred the immense\n",
      "brands with a long pole. within the furnace were seen the curling and\n",
      "riotous flames, and the burning marble, almost molten with the\n",
      "intensity of heat; while without, the reflection of the fire quivered\n",
      "on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest, and showed in the\n",
      "foreground a bright and ruddy little picture of the hut, the spring\n",
      "beside its door, the athletic and coal-begrimed figure of the\n",
      "lime-burner, and the half-frightened child, shrinking into the\n",
      "protection of his father's shadow. and when again the iron door was\n",
      "closed, then reappeared the tender light of the half-full moon, which\n",
      "vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring\n",
      "mountains; and, in the upper sky, there was a flitting congregation of\n",
      "clouds, still faintly tinged with the rosy sunset, though thus far\n",
      "down into the valley the sunshine had vanished long and long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "the little boy now crept still closer to his father, as footsteps were\n",
      "heard ascending the hillside, and a human form thrust aside the bushes\n",
      "that clustered beneath the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"halloo! who is it?\" cried the lime-burner, vexed at his son's\n",
      "timidity, yet half infected by it, \"come forward, and show yourself,\n",
      "like a man, or i'll fling this chunk of marble at your head !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you offer me a rough welcome,\" said a gloomy voice, as the unknown\n",

      "my own fireside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "to obtain a distincter view, bartram threw open the iron door of the\n",
      "kiln, whence immediately issued a gush of fierce light, that smote\n",
      "full upon the stranger's face and figure. to a careless eye there\n",
      "appeared nothing very remarkable in his aspect, which was that of a\n",
      "man in a coarse, brown, country-made suit of clothes, tall and thin,\n",
      "with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer. as he advanced, he fixed\n",
      "his eyes--which were very bright--intently upon the brightness of the\n",
      "furnace, as if he beheld, or expected to behold, some object worthy of\n",
      "note within it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good evening, stranger,\" said the lime-burner; \"whence come you, so\n",
      "late in the day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i come from my search,\" answered the wayfarer; \"for, at last, it is\n",
      "finished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"drunk!--or crazy!\" muttered bartram to himself. \"i shall have trouble\n",
      "with the fellow. the sooner i drive him away, the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the little boy, all in a tremble, whispered to his father, and begged\n",
      "him to shut the door of the kiln, so that there might not be so much\n",
      "light; for that there was something in the man's face which he was\n",
      "afraid to look at, yet could not look away from. and, indeed, even the\n",
      "lime-burner's dull and torpid sense began to be impressed by an\n",
      "indescribable something in that thin, rugged, thoughtful visage, with\n",
      "the grizzled hair hanging wildly about it, and those deeply sunken\n",
      "eyes, which gleamed like fires within the entrance of a mysterious\n",
      "cavern. but, as he closed the door, the stranger turned towards him,\n",
      "and spoke in a quiet, familiar way, that made bartram feel as if he\n",
      "were a sane and sensible man, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"your task draws to an end, i see,\" said he. \"this marble has already\n",
      "been burning three days. a few hours more will convert the stone to\n",
      "lime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, who are you?\" exclaimed the lime-burner. \"you seem as well\n",
      "acquainted with my business as i am myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and well i may be,\" said the stranger; \"for i followed the same craft\n",
      "many a long year, and here, too, on this very spot. but you are a\n",
      "newcomer in these parts. did you never hear of ethan brand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the man that went in search of the unpardonable sin?\" asked bartram,\n",
      "with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the same,\" answered the stranger. \"he has found what he sought, and\n",
      "therefore he comes back again,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what! then you are ethan brand himself?\" cried the lime-burner, in\n",
      "amazement. \"i am a newcomer here, as you say, and they call it\n",
      "eighteen years since you left the foot of graylock, but, i can tell\n",
      "you, the good folks still talk about ethan brand, in the village\n",
      "yonder, and what a strange errand took him away from his lime-kiln.\n",
      "well and so you have found the unpardonable sin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"even so!\" said the stranger, calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"if the 'question is a fair one.\" proceeded bartrarn, \"where might it\n",
      "be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ethan brand laid his finger on his own heart.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"here!\" replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "and then, without mirth in his countenance, but as if moved by an\n",
      "involuntary recognition of the infinite absurdity of seeking\n",
      "throughout the world for what was the closest of all things to\n",
      "himself, and looking into every heart, save his own, for what was\n",
      "hidden in no other breast, he broke into a laugh of scorn. it was the\n",
      "same slow, heavy laugh that had almost appalled the lime-burner when\n",
      "it heralded the wayfarer's approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "the solitary mountain side was made dismal by it. laughter, when out\n",
      "of place, mistimed, or bursting forth from a disordered state of\n",
      "feeling, may be the most terrible modulation of the human voice. the\n",
      "laughter of one asleep, even if it be a little child,--the madman's\n",
      "laugh,--the wild, screaming laugh of a born idiot,--are sounds that we\n",
      "sometimes tremble to hear, and would always willingly forget. poets\n",
      "have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully\n",
      "appropriate as a laugh. and even the obtuse lime-burner felt his\n",
      "nerves shaken, as this strange man looked inward at his own heart, and\n",
      "burst into laughter that rolled away into the night, and was\n",
      "indistinctly reverberated among the hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"joe,\" said he to his little son, \"scamper down to the tavern in the\n",
      "village, and tell the jolly fellows there that ethan brand has come\n",
      "back, and that he has found the unpardonable sin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the boy darted away on his errand, to which ethan brand made no\n",
      "objection, nor seemed hardly to notice it. he sat on a log of wood,\n",
      "looking steadfastly at the iron door of the kiln. when the child was\n",
      "out of sight, and his swift and light footsteps ceased to be heard\n",
      "treading first on the fallen leaves and then on the rocky mountain\n",
      "path, the lime-burner began to regret his departure. he felt that the\n",
      "little fellow's presence had been a barrier between his guest and\n",
      "himself, and that he must now deal, heart to heart, with a man who, on\n",
      "his own confession, had committed the one only crime for which heaven\n",
      "could afford no mercy. that crime, in its indistinct blackness, seemed\n",
      "to overshadow him. the lime-burner's own sins rose up within him, and\n",
      "made his memory riotous with a throng of evil shapes that asserted\n",
      "their kindred with the master sin, whatever it might be, which it was\n",
      "within the scope of man's corrupted nature to conceive and cherish.\n",
      "they were all of one family; they went to and fro between his breast\n",
      "and ethan brand's, and carried dark greetings from one to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "then bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in\n",
      "reference to this strange man, who had come upon him like a shadow of\n",
      "the night, and was making himself at home in his old place, after so\n",
      "long absence that the dead people, dead and buried for years, would\n",
      "have had more right to be at home, in any familiar spot, than he.\n",
      "ethan brand, it was said, had conversed with satan himself in the\n",
      "lurid blaze of this very kiln. the legend had been matter of mirth\n",
      "heretofore, but looked grisly now. according to this tale, before\n",
      "ethan brand departed on his search, he had been accustomed to evoke a\n",
      "fiend from the hot furnace of the lime-kiln, night after night, in\n",
      "order to confer with him about the unpardonable sin; the man and the\n",
      "fiend each laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt which\n",
      "could neither be atoned for nor forgiven. and, with the first gleam of\n",
      "light upon the mountain-top, the fiend crept in at the iron door,\n",
      "there to abide the intensest element of fire, until again summoned\n",
      "forth to share in the dreadful task of extending man's possible guilt\n",
      "beyond the scope of heaven's else infinite mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "while the lime-burner was struggling with the horror of these\n",
      "thoughts, ethan brand rose from the log, and flung open the door of\n",
      "the kiln. the action was in such accordance with the idea in bartram's\n",
      "mind, that he almost expected to see the evil one issue forth, red-hot\n",
      "from the raging furnace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"hold! hold!\" cried he, with a tremulous attempt to laugh; for he was\n",
      "ashamed of his fears, although they overmastered him. \"don't, for\n",
      "mercy's sake, bring out your devil now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"man!\" sternly replied ethan brand, \"what need have i of the devil? i\n",
      "have left him behind me, on my track. it is with such halfway sinners\n",
      "as you that he busies himself. fear not, because i open the door. i do\n",
      "but act by old custom, and am going to trim your fire, like a\n",
      "lime-burner, as i was once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he stirred the vast coals, thrust in more wood, and bent forward to\n",
      "gaze into the hollow prison-house of the fire, regardless of the\n",
      "fierce glow that reddened upon his face. the lime-burner sat watching\n",
      "him, and half suspected his strange guest of a purpose, if not to\n",
      "evoke a fiend, at least to plunge bodily into the flames, and thus\n",
      "vanish from the sight of man. ethan brand, however, drew quietly back,\n",
      "and closed the door of the kiln.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have looked,\" said he, \"into many a human heart that was seven\n",
      "times hotter with sinful passions than yonder furnace is with fire.\n",
      "but i found not there what i sought. no, not the unpardonable sin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what is the unpardonable sin?\" asked the lime-burner; and then he\n",
      "shrank farther from his companion, trembling lest his question should\n",
      "be answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is a sin that grew within my own breast,\" replied ethan brand,\n",
      "standing erect, with a pride that distinguishes all enthusiasts of his\n",
      "stamp. \"a sin that grew nowhere else! the sin of an intellect that\n",
      "triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for\n",
      "god, and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims! the only sin\n",
      "that deserves a recompense of immortal agony! freely, were it to do\n",
      "again, would i incur the guilt. unshrinkingly i accept the\n",
      "retribution!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the man's head is turned,\" muttered the lime-burner to himself. \"he\n",
      "may be a sinner, like the rest of us,--nothing more likely,--but, i'll\n",
      "be sworn, he is a madman too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless, he felt uncomfortable at his situation, alone with ethan\n",
      "brand on the wild mountain side, and was right glad to hear the rough\n",
      "murmur of tongues, and the footsteps of what seemed a pretty numerous\n",
      "party, stumbling over the stones and rustling through the under-brush.\n",
      "soon appeared the whole lazy regiment that was wont to infest the\n",
      "village tavern, comprehending three or four individuals who had drunk\n",
      "flip beside the bar-room fire through all the winters, and smoked\n",
      "their pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers, since ethan\n",
      "brand's departure. laughing boisterously, and mingling all their\n",
      "voices together in unceremonious talk, they now burst into the\n",
      "moonshine and narrow streaks of firelight that illuminated the open\n",
      "space before the lime-kiln. bartram set the door ajar again, flooding\n",
      "the spot with light, that the whole company might get a fair view of\n",
      "ethan brand, and he of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "there, among other old acquaintances, was a once ubiquitous[3] man,\n",
      "now almost extinct, but whom we were formerly sure to encounter at the\n",
      "hotel of every thriving village throughout the country. it was the\n",
      "stage-agent. the present specimen of the genus was a wilted and\n",
      "smoke-dried man, wrinkled and red-nosed, in a smartly cut, brown,\n",
      "bob-tailed coat, with brass buttons, who, for a length of time\n",
      "unknown, had kept his desk and corner in the bar-room, and was still\n",
      "puffing what seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty\n",
      "years before. he had great fame as a dry joker, though, perhaps, less\n",
      "on account of any intrinsic humor than from a certain flavor of brandy\n",
      "toddy and tobacco smoke, which impregnated all his ideas and\n",
      "expressions, as well as his person. another well-remembered though\n",
      "strangely altered face was that of lawyer giles, as people still\n",
      "called him in courtesy; an elderly ragamuffin, in his soiled\n",
      "shirt-sleeves and tow-cloth trousers. this poor fellow had been an\n",
      "attorney, in what he called his better days, a sharp practitioner, and\n",
      "in great vogue among the village litigants; but flip, and sling, and\n",
      "toddy, and cocktails, imbibed at all hours, morning, noon, and night,\n",
      "had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and degrees\n",
      "of bodily labor, till, at last, to adopt his own phrase, he slid into\n",
      "a soap vat. in other words, giles was now a soap boiler, in a small\n",
      "way. he had come to be but the fragment of a human being, a part of\n",
      "one foot having been chopped off by an axe, and an entire hand torn\n",
      "away by the devilish grip of a steam engine. yet, though the corporeal\n",
      "hand was gone, a spiritual member remained; for, stretching forth the\n",
      "stump, giles steadfastly averred that he felt an invisible thumb and\n",
      "fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were\n",
      "amputated. a maimed and miserable wretch he was; but one,\n",
      "nevertheless, whom the world could not trample on, and had no right to\n",
      "scorn, either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes, since\n",
      "he had still kept up the courage and spirit of a man, asked nothing in\n",
      "charity, and with his one hand--and that the left one--fought a stern\n",
      "battle against want and hostile circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "among the throng, too, came another personage, who, with certain\n",
      "points of similarity to lawyer giles, had many more of difference. it\n",
      "was the village doctor; a man of some fifty years, whom, at an earlier\n",
      "period of his life, we introduced as paying a professional visit to\n",
      "ethan brand during the latter's supposed insanity. he was now a\n",
      "purple-visaged, rude, and brutal, yet half-gentlemanly figure, with\n",
      "something wild, ruined, and desperate in his talk, and in all the\n",
      "details of his gesture and manners. brandy possessed this man like an\n",
      "evil spirit, and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast, and as\n",
      "miserable as a lost soul; but there was supposed to be in him such\n",
      "wonderful skill, such native gifts of healing, beyond any which\n",
      "medical science could impart, that society caught hold of him, and\n",
      "would not let him sink out of its reach. so, swaying to and fro upon\n",
      "his horse, and grumbling thick accents at the bedside, he visited all\n",
      "the sick chambers for miles about among the mountain towns, and\n",
      "sometimes raised a dying man, as it were, by miracle, or quite as\n",
      "often, no doubt, sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year\n",
      "too soon. the doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth, and, as\n",
      "somebody said, in allusion to his habit of swearing, it was always\n",
      "alight with hell-fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "these three worthies pressed forward, and greeted ethan brand each\n",
      "after his own fashion, earnestly inviting him to partake of the\n",
      "contents of a certain black bottle, in which, as they averred, he\n",
      "would find something far better worth seeking for than the\n",
      "unpardonable sin. no mind, which has wrought itself by intense and\n",
      "solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm, can endure the\n",
      "kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to\n",
      "which ethan brand was now subjected. it made him doubt--and, strange\n",
      "to say, it was a painful doubt,--whether he had indeed found the\n",
      "unpardonable sin and found it within himself. the whole question on\n",
      "which he had exhausted life, and more than life, looked like a\n",
      "delusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"leave me,\" he said bitterly, \"ye brute beasts, that have made\n",

      "found nothing there for my purpose. get ye gone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why, you uncivil scoundrel,\" cried the fierce doctor, \"is that the\n",
      "way you respond to the kindness of your best friends? then let me tell\n",
      "you the truth. you have no more found the unpardonable sin than yonder\n",
      "boy joe has. you are but a crazy fellow,--i told you so twenty years\n",
      "ago,--neither better nor worse than a crazy fellow, and a fit\n",
      "companion of old humphrey, here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he pointed to an old man, shabbily dressed, with long white hair, thin\n",
      "visage, and unsteady eyes. for some years past this aged person had\n",
      "been wandering about among the hills, inquiring of all travellers whom\n",
      "he met for his daughter. the girl, it seemed, had gone off with a\n",
      "company of circus performers; and occasionally tidings of her came to\n",
      "the village, and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance\n",
      "as she rode on horseback in the ring, or performed marvellous feats on\n",
      "the tight rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "the white-haired father now approached ethan brand, and gazed\n",
      "unsteadily into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"they tell me you have been all over the earth,\" said he, wringing his\n",
      "hands with earnestness. \"you must have seen my daughter, for she makes\n",
      "a grand figure in the world, and everybody goes to see her. did she\n",
      "send any word to her old father, or say when she was coming back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ethan brand's eye quailed beneath the old man's. that daughter, from\n",
      "whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting, was the esther of our\n",
      "tale, the very girl whom, with such cold and remorseless purpose,\n",
      "ethan brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment, and\n",
      "wasted, absorbed, and perhaps annihilated her soul, in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" murmured he, turning away from the hoary wanderer; \"it is no\n",
      "delusion. there is an unpardonable sin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "while these things were passing, a merry scene was going forward in\n",
      "the area of cheerful light, beside the spring and before the door of\n",
      "the hut. a number of the youth of the village, young men and girls,\n",
      "had hurried up the hillside, impelled by curiosity to see ethan brand,\n",
      "the hero of so many a legend familiar to their childhood. finding\n",
      "nothing, however, very remarkable in his aspect,--nothing but a\n",
      "sunburnt wayfarer, in plain garb and dusty shoes, who sat looking into\n",
      "the fire, as if he fancied pictures among the coals,--these young\n",
      "people speedily grew tired of observing him. as it happened, there was\n",
      "other amusement at hand. an old german jew, travelling with a\n",
      "diorama[4] on his back, was passing down, the mountain road towards\n",
      "the village just as the party turned aside from it, and, in hopes of\n",
      "eking out the profits of the day, the showman had kept them company to\n",
      "the lime-kiln.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"come, old dutchman,\" cried one of the young men, \"let us see your\n",

      "\n",
      "\"o yes, captain,\" answered the jew,--whether as a matter of courtesy\n",
      "or craft, he styled everybody captain,--\"i shall show you, indeed,\n",

      "so, placing his box in a proper position, he invited the young men and\n",

      "venerable quadruped, of his own mere motion, and without the slightest\n",

      "lighter verdure of sapling oaks, maples, and poplars, while here and\n",
      "there lay the gigantic corpses of dead trees, decaying on the\n",
      "leaf-strewn soil. and it seemed to little joe--a timorous and\n",

      "until some fearful thing should happen.\n",

      "ethan brand thrust more wood into the fire, and closed the door of the\n",

      "what love and sympathy for mankind, and what pity for human guilt and\n",
      "woe, he had first begun to contemplate those ideas which afterwards\n",
      "became the inspiration of his life; with what reverence he had then\n",

      "divine, and, however desecrated, still to be held sacred by a brother;\n",
      "with what awful fear he had deprecated the success of his pursuit, and\n",

      "ensued that vast intellectual development, which, in its progress,\n",
      "disturbed the counterpoise between his mind and heart. the idea that\n",

      "indeed, had withered,--had contracted.--had hardened,--had perished!\n",
      "it had ceased to partake of the universal throb, he had lost his hold\n",
      "of the magnetic chain of humanity. he was no longer a brother-man,\n",
      "opening the chambers of the dungeons of our common nature by the key\n",
      "of holy sympathy, which gave him a right to share in all its secrets;\n",
      "he was now a cold observer, looking on mankind as the subject of his\n",

      "broken marble with which the kiln was heaped. all these innumerable\n",

      "scorched and shrivelled him up in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "ethan brand stood erect, and raised his arms on high. the blue flames\n",
      "played upon his face, and imparted the wild and ghastly light which\n",

      "verge of plunging into his gulf of intensest torment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"o mother earth,\" cried he, \"who art no more my mother, and into whose\n",

      "the rude hovel, when they opened their eyes to the daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"up, boy, up!\" cried the lime-burner, staring about him. \"thank\n",
      "heaven, the night is gone, at last; and rather than pass such another,\n",
      "i would watch, my lime-kiln, wide awake, for a twelvemonth. this ethan\n",

      "hastening onward. the village, completely shut in by hills, which\n",
      "swelled away gently about it, looked as if it had rested peacefully in\n",
      "the hollow of the great hand of providence. every dwelling was\n",
      "distinctly visible; the little spires of the two churches pointed\n",
      "upwards, and caught a fore-glimmering of brightness from the sun-gilt\n",
      "skies upon their gilded weathercocks. the tavern was astir, and the\n",
      "figure of the old, smoke-dried stage-agent, cigar in mouth, was seen\n",
      "beneath the stoop. old graylock was glorified with a golden cloud upon\n",
      "his head. scattered likewise over the breasts of the surrounding\n",
      "mountains, there were heaps of hoary mist, in fantastic shapes, some\n",
      "of them far down into the valley, others high up towards the summits,\n",
      "and still others, of the same family of mist or cloud, hovering in the\n",
      "gold radiance of the upper atmosphere. stepping from one to another of\n",
      "the clouds that rested on the hills, and thence to the loftier\n",
      "brotherhood that sailed in air, it seemed almost as if a mortal man\n",
      "might thus ascend into the heavenly regions. earth was so mingled with\n",
      "sky that it was a day-dream to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "to supply that charm of the familiar and homely, which nature so\n",
      "readily adopts into a scene like this, the stage-coach was rattling\n",
      "down the mountain road, and the driver sounded his horn, while echo\n",
      "caught up the notes, and intertwined them into a rich and varied and\n",
      "elaborate harmony, of which the original performer could lay claim to\n",
      "little share. the great hills played a concert among themselves, each\n",

      "\"yes,\" growled the lime-burner, with an oath, \"but he has let the fire\n",

      "his horse with due care, and supped with due deliberation; and then,\n",
      "in a very agreeable frame of mind, went out to pay a visit in the gray\n",
      "of the evening. it was not a very wise proceeding on the young man's\n",
      "part. he would have done better to remain beside the fire or go\n",

      "lighted up; and the noise of men-at-arms making merry over supper\n",
      "within came forth in fits and was swallowed up and carried away by the\n",

      "spire top, grew ever fainter and fainter against the flying clouds--a\n",
      "black speck like a swallow in the tumultuous, leaden chaos of the sky.\n",

      "denis looked down, and could discern a few tree-tops waving and a\n",
      "single speck of brightness where the river ran across a weir. the\n",
      "weather was clearing up, and the sky had lightened, so as to show the\n",
      "outline of the heavier clouds and the dark margin of the hills. by the\n",
      "uncertain glimmer, the house on his left hand should be a place of\n",
      "some pretensions; it was surmounted by several pinnacles and\n",
      "turret-tops; the round stern of a chapel, with a fringe of flying\n",
      "buttresses, projected boldly from the main block; and the door was\n",
      "sheltered under a deep porch carved with figures and overhung by two\n",
      "long gargoyles[3]. the windows of the chapel gleamed through their\n",
      "intricate tracery with a light as of many tapers, and threw out the\n",
      "buttresses and the peaked roof in a more intense blackness against the\n",
      "sky. it was plainly the hotel of some great family of the\n",
      "neighborhood; and as it reminded denis of a town house of his own at\n",
      "bourges, he stood for some time gazing up at it and mentally gauging\n",
      "the skill of the architects and the consideration of the two families.\n",
      "\n",
      "there seemed to be no issue to the terrace but the lane by which he\n",
      "had reached it; he could only retrace his steps, but he had gained\n",
      "some notion of his whereabouts, and hoped by this means to hit the\n",
      "main thoroughfare and speedily regain the inn. he was reckoning\n",
      "without that chapter of accidents which was to make this night\n",
      "memorable above all others in his career; for he had not gone back\n",
      "above a hundred yards before he saw a light coming to meet him, and\n",
      "heard loud voices speaking together in the echoing narrows of the\n",
      "lane. it was a party of men-at-arms going the night round with\n",
      "torches. denis assured himself that they had all been making free with\n",
      "the wine bowl, and were in no mood to be particular about\n",
      "safe-conducts or the niceties of chivalrous war. it, was as like as\n",
      "not that they would kill him like a dog and leave him where he fell.\n",
      "the situation was inspiriting but nervous. their own torches would\n",
      "conceal him from sight, he reflected; and he hoped that they would\n",
      "drown the noise of his footsteps with their own empty voices. if he\n",
      "were but fleet and silent, he might evade their notice altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "unfortunately, as he turned to beat a retreat, his foot rolled upon a\n",
      "pebble; he fell against the wall with an ejaculation, and his sword\n",
      "rang loudly on the stones. two or three voices demanded who went\n",
      "there--some in french, some in english; but denis made no reply, and\n",
      "ran the faster down the lane. once upon the terrace, he paused to look\n",
      "back. they still kept calling after him, and just then began to double\n",
      "the pace in pursuit, with a considerable clank of armor, and great\n",
      "tossing of the torchlight to and fro in the narrow jaws of the\n",
      "passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "denis cast a look around and darted into the porch. there he might\n",
      "escape observation, or--if that were too much to expect--was in a\n",
      "capital posture whether for parley or defence. so thinking, he drew\n",
      "his sword and tried to set his back against the door. to his surprise\n",
      "it yielded behind his weight; and though he turned in a moment,\n",
      "continued to swing back on oiled and noiseless hinges until it stood\n",
      "wide open on a black interior. when things fall out opportunely for\n",
      "the person concerned, he is not apt to be critical about the how or\n",
      "why, his own immediate personal convenience seeming a sufficient\n",
      "reason for the strangest oddities and revolutions in our sublunary\n",
      "things; and so denis, without a moment's hesitation, stepped within\n",
      "and partly closed the door behind him to conceal his place of refuge.\n",
      "nothing was further from his thoughts than to close it altogether; but\n",
      "for some inexplicable reason--perhaps by a spring or a weight--the\n",
      "ponderous mass of oak whipped itself out of his fingers and clanked\n",
      "to, with a formidable rumble and a noise like the falling of an\n",
      "automatic bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "the round, at that very moment, debouched[4] upon the terrace and\n",
      "proceeded to summon him with shouts and curses. he heard them\n",
      "ferreting in the dark corners; the stock of a lance even rattled along\n",
      "the outer surface of the door behind which he stood; but these\n",
      "gentlemen were in too high a humor to be long delayed, and soon made\n",
      "off down a corkscrew pathway which had escaped denis' observation, and\n",
      "passed out of sight and hearing along the battlements of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "denis breathed again. he gave them a few minutes' grace for fear of\n",
      "accidents, and then groped about for some means of opening the door\n",
      "and slipping forth again. the inner surface was quite smooth, not a\n",
      "handle, not a moulding, not a projection of any sort. he got his\n",
      "finger nails round the edges and pulled, but the mass was immovable.\n",
      "he shook it, it was as firm as a rock, denis de beaulieu frowned, and\n",
      "gave vent to a little noiseless whistle. what ailed the door? he\n",
      "wondered. why was it open? how came it to shut so easily and so\n",
      "effectually after him? there was something obscure and underhand about\n",
      "all this, that was little to the young man's fancy. it looked like a\n",
      "snare, and yet who could suppose a snare in such a quiet by-street and\n",
      "in a house of so prosperous and even noble an exterior? and yet--snare\n",
      "or no snare, intentionally or unintentionally--here he was, prettily\n",
      "trapped; and for the life of him he could see no way out of it again.\n",
      "the darkness began to weigh upon him. he gave ear; all was silent\n",
      "without, but within and close by he seemed to catch a faint sighing, a\n",
      "faint sobbing rustle, a little stealthy creak--as though many persons\n",
      "were at his side, holding themselves quite still, and governing even\n",
      "their respiration with the extreme of slyness. the idea went to his\n",
      "vitals with a shock, and he faced about suddenly as if to defend his\n",
      "life. then, for the first time, he became aware of a light about the\n",
      "level of his eyes and at some distance in the interior of the house--a\n",
      "vertical thread of light, widening toward the bottom, such as might\n",
      "escape between two wings of arras over a doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "to see anything was a relief to denis; it was like a piece of solid\n",
      "ground to a man laboring in a morass; his mind seized upon it with\n",
      "avidity; and he stood staring at it and trying to piece together some\n",
      "logical conception of his surroundings. plainly there was a flight of\n",
      "steps ascending from his own level to that of this illuminated\n",
      "doorway, and indeed he thought he could make out another thread of\n",
      "light, as fine as a needle and as faint as phosphorescence, which\n",
      "might very well be reflected along the polished wood of a handrail.\n",
      "since he had begun to suspect that he was not alone, his heart had\n",
      "continued to beat with smothering violence, and an intolerable desire\n",
      "for action of any sort had possessed itself of his spirit. he was in\n",
      "deadly peril, he believed. what could be more natural than to mount\n",
      "the staircase, lift the curtain, and confront his difficulty at once?\n",
      "at least he would be dealing with something tangible; at least he\n",
      "would be no longer in the dark. he stepped slowly forward with\n",
      "outstretched hands, until his foot struck the bottom step; then he\n",
      "rapidly scaled the stairs, stood for a moment to compose his\n",
      "expression, lifted the arras and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "he found himself in a large apartment of polished stone. there were\n",
      "three doors, one on each of three sides, all similarly curtained with\n",
      "tapestry. the fourth side was occupied by two large windows and a\n",
      "great stone chimney-piece, carved with the arms of the maletroits.\n",
      "denis recognized the bearings, and was gratified to find himself in\n",
      "such good hands. the room was strongly illuminated; but it contained\n",
      "little furniture except a heavy table and a chair or two; the hearth\n",
      "was innocent of fire, and the pavement was but sparsely strewn with\n",
      "rushes clearly many days old.\n",
      "\n",
      "on a high chair beside the chimney, and directly facing denis as he\n",
      "entered, sat a little old gentleman in a fur tippet. he sat with his\n",
      "legs crossed and his hands folded, and a cup of spiced wine stood by\n",
      "his elbow on a bracket on the wall. his countenance had a strong\n",
      "masculine cast; not properly human, but such as we see in the bull,\n",
      "the goat, or the domestic boar; something equivocal and wheedling,\n",
      "something greedy, brutal and dangerous. the upper lip was inordinately\n",
      "full, as though swollen by a blow or a toothache; and the smile, the\n",
      "peaked eyebrows, and the small, strong eyes were quaintly and almost\n",
      "comically evil in expression. beautiful white hair hung straight all\n",
      "round his head, like a saint's, and fell in a single curl upon the\n",
      "tippet. his beard and mustache were the pink of venerable sweetness.\n",
      "age, probably in consequence of inordinate precautions, had left no\n",
      "mark upon his hands; and the maletroit hand was famous. it would be\n",
      "difficult to imagine anything at once so fleshy and so delicate in\n",
      "design; the taper, sensual fingers were like those of one of\n",
      "leonardo's[5] women; the fork of the thumb made a dimpled protuberance\n",
      "when closed; the nails were perfectly shaped, and of a dead,\n",
      "surprising whiteness. it rendered his aspect tenfold more redoubtable,\n",
      "that a man with hands like these should keep them devoutly folded like\n",
      "a virgin martyr--that a man with so intent and startling an expression\n",
      "of face should sit patiently on his seat and contemplates people with\n",
      "an unwinking stare, like a god, or a god's statue. his quiescence\n",
      "seemed ironical and treacherous, it fitted so poorly with his looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "such was alain, sire de maletroit.\n",
      "\n",
      "denis and he looked silently at each other for a second or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"pray step in,\" said the sire de maletroit. \"i have been expecting you\n",
      "all the evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he had not risen, but he accompanied his words with a smile and a\n",
      "slight but courteous inclination of the head. partly from the smile,\n",
      "partly from the strange musical murmur with which the sire prefaced\n",
      "his observation, denis felt a strong shudder of disgust go through his\n",
      "marrow. and what with disgust and honest confusion of mind, he could\n",
      "scarcely get words together in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i fear,\" he said, \"that this is a double accident. i am not the\n",
      "person you suppose me. it seems you were looking for a visit; but for\n",
      "my part, nothing was further from my thoughts--nothing could be more\n",
      "contrary to my wishes--than this intrusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, well,\" replied the old gentleman indulgently, \"here you are,\n",
      "which is the main point. seat yourself, my friend, and put yourself\n",
      "entirely at your ease. we shall arrange our little affairs presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "denis perceived that the matter was still complicated with some\n",
      "misconception, and he hastened to continue his explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"your door,\" he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"about my door?\" asked the other raising his peaked eyebrows. \"a\n",
      "little piece of ingenuity.\" and he shrugged his shoulders. \"a\n",
      "hospitable fancy! by your own account, you were not desirous of making\n",
      "any acquaintance. we old people look for such reluctance now and then;\n",
      "when it touches our honor, we cast about until we find some way of\n",
      "overcoming it. you arrive uninvited, but believe me, very welcome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you persist in error, sir,\" said denis. \"there can be no question\n",
      "between you and me. i am a stranger in this countryside. my name is\n",
      "denis, damoiseau de beaulieu. if you see me in your house it is\n",
      "only--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my young friend,\" interrupted the other, \"you will permit me to have\n",
      "my own ideas on that subject. they probably differ from yours at the\n",
      "present moment,\" he added with a leer, \"but time will show which of us\n",
      "is in the right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "denis was convinced he had to do with a lunatic. he seated himself\n",
      "with a shrug, content to wait the upshot; and a pause ensued, during\n",
      "which he thought he could distinguish a hurried gabbling as of a\n",
      "prayer from behind the arras immediately opposite him. sometimes there\n",
      "seemed to be but one person engaged, sometimes two; and the vehemence\n",
      "of the voice, low as it was, seemed to indicate either great haste or\n",
      "an agony of spirit. it occurred to him that this piece of tapestry\n",
      "covered the entrance to the chapel he had noticed from without.\n",
      "\n",
      "the old gentleman meanwhile surveyed denis from head to foot with a\n",
      "smile, and from time to time emitted little noises like a bird or a\n",
      "mouse, which seemed to indicate a high degree of satisfaction. this\n",
      "state of matters became rapidly insupportable; and denis, to put an\n",
      "end to it, remarked politely that the wind had gone down.\n",
      "\n",
      "the old gentleman fell into a fit of silent laughter, so prolonged and\n",
      "violent that he became quite red in the face. denis got upon his feet\n",
      "at once, and put on his hat with a flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"sir,\" he said, \"if you are in your wits, you have affronted me\n",
      "grossly. if you are out of them, i flatter myself i can find better\n",
      "employment for my brains than to talk with lunatics. my conscience is\n",
      "clear; you have made a fool of me from the first moment; you have\n",
      "refused to hear my explanations; and now there is no power under god\n",
      "will make me stay here any longer; and if i cannot make my way out in\n",
      "a more decent fashion, i will hack your door in pieces with my sword.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the sire de maletroit raised his right hand and wagged it at denis\n",
      "with the fore and little fingers extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my dear nephew,\" he said, \"sit down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"nephew!\" retorted denis, \"you lie in your throat;\" and he snapped his\n",
      "fingers in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"sit down, you rogue!\" cried the old gentleman, in a sudden, harsh\n",
      "voice like the barking of a dog. \"do you fancy,\" he went on, \"that\n",
      "when i had made my little contrivance for the door i had stopped short\n",
      "with that? if you prefer to be bound hand and foot till your bones\n",
      "ache, rise and try to go away. if you choose to remain a free young\n",
      "buck, agreeably conversing with an old gentleman--why, sit where you\n",
      "are in peace, and god be with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"do you mean, i am a prisoner?\" demanded denis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i state the facts,\" replied the other. \"i would rather leave the\n",
      "conclusion to yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "denis sat down again. externally he managed to keep pretty calm, but\n",
      "within, he was now boiling with anger, now chilled with apprehension.\n",
      "he no longer felt convinced that he was dealing with a madman. and if\n",
      "the old gentleman was sane, what, in god's name, had he to look for?\n",
      "what absurd or tragical adventure had befallen him? what countenance\n",
      "was he to assume?\n",
      "\n",
      "while he was thus unpleasantly reflecting, the arras that overhung the\n",
      "chapel door was raised, and a tall priest in his robes came forth,\n",
      "and, giving a long, keen stare at denis, said something in an\n",
      "undertone to sire de maletroit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she is in a better frame of spirit?\" asked the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she is more resigned, messire,\" replied the priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"now the lord help her, she is hard to please!\" sneered the old\n",
      "gentleman. \"a likely stripling--not ill-born--and of her own choosing,\n",
      "too? why, what more would the jade have?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the situation is not usual for a young damsel,\" said the other, \"and\n",
      "somewhat trying to her blushes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she should have thought of that before she began the dance! it was\n",
      "none of my choosing, god knows that; but since she is in it, by our\n",
      "lady, she shall carry it to the end.\" and then addressing denis,\n",
      "\"monsieur de beaulieu,\" he asked, \"may i present you to my niece? she\n",
      "has been waiting your arrival, i may say, with even greater impatience\n",
      "than myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "denis had resigned himself with a good grace--all he desired was to\n",
      "know the worst of it as speedily as possible; so he rose at once, and\n",
      "bowed in acquiescence. the sire de maletroit followed his example and\n",
      "limped, with the assistance of the chaplain's arm, toward the chapel\n",
      "door. the priest pulled aside the arras, and all three entered. the\n",
      "building had considerable architectural pretensions. a light groining\n",
      "sprang from six stout columns, and hung down in two rich pendants from\n",
      "the centre of the vault. the place terminated behind the altar in a\n",
      "round end, embossed and honeycombed with a superfluity of ornament in\n",
      "relief, and pierced by many little windows shaped like stars,\n",
      "trefoils, or wheels. these windows were imperfectly is glazed, so that\n",
      "the night air circulated freely in the chapel. the tapers, of which\n",
      "there must have been half a hundred burning on the altar, were\n",
      "unmercifully blown about; and the light went through many different\n",
      "phases of brilliancy and semi-eclipse. on the steps in front of the\n",
      "altar knelt a young girl richly attired as a bride. a chill settled\n",
      "over denis as he observed her costume; he fought with desperate energy\n",
      "against the conclusion that was being thrust upon his mind; it could\n",
      "not--it should not--be as he feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"blanche,\" said the sire, in his most flute-like tones, \"i have\n",
      "brought a friend to see you, my little girl; turn round and give him\n",
      "your pretty hand. it is good to be devout; but it is necessary to be\n",
      "polite, my niece.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl rose to her feet and turned toward the newcomers. she moved\n",
      "all of a piece; and shame and exhaustion were expressed in every line\n",
      "of her fresh young body; and she held her head down and kept her eyes\n",
      "upon the pavement, as she came slowly forward. in the course of her\n",
      "advance her eyes fell upon denis de beaulieu's feet--feet of which he\n",
      "was justly vain, be it remarked, and wore in the most elegant\n",
      "accoutrement even while travelling. she paused--started, as if his\n",
      "yellow boots had conveyed some shocking meaning--and glanced, suddenly\n",
      "up into the wearer's countenance. their eyes met; shame gave place to\n",
      "horror and terror in her looks; the blood left her lips, with a\n",
      "piercing scream she covered her face with her hands and sank upon, the\n",
      "chapel floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that is not the man!\" she cried. \"my uncle, that is not the man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the sire de maletroit chirped agreeably. \"of course not,\" he said; \"i\n",
      "expected as much. it was so unfortunate you could not remember his\n",
      "name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"indeed,\" she cried, \"indeed, i have never seen this person till this\n",
      "moment--i have never so much as set eyes upon him--i never wish to see\n",
      "him again. sir,\" she said, turning to denis, \"if you are a gentleman,\n",
      "you will hear me out. have i ever seen you--have you ever seen\n",
      "me--before this accursed hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to speak for myself, i have never had that pleasure,\" answered the\n",
      "young man. \"this is the first time, messire, that i have met with your\n",
      "engaging niece.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the old gentleman shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am distressed to hear it,\" he said. \"but it is never too late to\n",
      "begin. i had little more acquaintance with my own late lady ere i\n",
      "married her; which proves,\" he added, with a grimace, \"that these\n",
      "impromptu marriages may often produce an excellent understanding in\n",
      "the long run. as the bridegroom is to have a voice in the matter, i\n",
      "will give him two hours to make up for lost time before we proceed\n",
      "with the ceremony.\" and he turned toward the door, followed by the\n",
      "clergyman.\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl was on her feet in a moment. \"my uncle, you cannot be in\n",
      "earnest,\" she said. \"i declare before god i will stab myself rather\n",
      "than be forced on that young man. the heart rises at it; god forbids\n",
      "such marriages; you dishonor your white hair. oh, my uncle, pity me!\n",
      "there is not a woman in all the world but would prefer death to such a\n",
      "nuptial. is it possible,\" she added, faltering--\"is it possible that\n",
      "you do not believe me--that you still think this\"--and she pointed at\n",
      "denis with a tremor of anger and contempt--\"that you still think\n",
      "_this_ to be the man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"frankly,\" said the old gentleman, pausing on the threshold, \"i do.\n",
      "but let me explain to you once for all, blanche de maletroit, my way\n",

      "began to stand near me every day in church. i could see that i pleased\n",
      "him; i am much to blame, but i was so glad that any one should love\n",
      "me; and when he passed me a letter, i took it home with me and read it\n",
      "with great pleasure. since that time he has written many. he was so\n",

      "sob at that, and it was a moment before she could go on. \"my uncle is\n",
      "a hard man, but he is very shrewd,\" she said, at last. \"he has\n",
      "performed many feats in war, and was a great person at court, and much\n",
      "trusted by queen isabeau in old days. how he came to suspect me i\n",

      "\"when he finished, he gave it back to me with great politeness. it\n",

      "windows which stood open on the night. \"you observe,\" he went on,\n",
      "\"there is an iron ring in the upper masonry, and reeved through that,\n",

      "hanged out of this window before sunrise. i shall only proceed to such\n",
      "an extremity with the greatest regret, you may believe me. for it is\n",
      "not at all your death that i desire, but my niece's establishment in\n",
      "life. at the same time, it must come to that if you prove obstinate.\n",
      "your family, monsieur de beaulieu, is very well in its way; but if you\n",
      "sprung from charlemagne[7], you should not refuse the hand of a\n",
      "maletroit with impunity--not if she had been as common as the paris\n",

      "my niece nor you, nor my own private feelings, move me at all in this\n",

      "hardly wonder if i request you to wipe out the stain. if you will not,\n",
      "your blood be on your own head! it will be no great satisfaction to me\n",
      "to have your interesting relics kicking their heels in the breeze\n",

      "cannot cure the dishonor, i shall at least stop the scandal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i believe there are other ways of settling such imbroglios among\n",

      "the sire de maletroit made a signal to the chaplain, who crossed the\n",

      "strength i have. this is one of the hardest things to swallow as a man\n",
      "grows up in years; but with a little patience, even this becomes\n",
      "habitual. you and the lady seem to prefer the _salle_ for what remains\n",
      "of your two hours; and as i have no desire to cross your preference, i\n",
      "shall resign it to your use with all the pleasure in the world. no\n",
      "haste!\" he added, holding up his hand, as he saw a dangerous look come\n",
      "into denis de beaulieu's face. \"if your mind revolt against hanging,\n",
      "it will be time enough two hours hence to throw yourself out of the\n",
      "window or upon the pikes of my retainers. two hours of life are always\n",
      "two hours. a great many things may turn up in even as little a while\n",
      "as that. and, besides. if i understand her appearance, my niece has\n",

      "\n",
      "messire de maletroit bowed, and proceeded to limp about the apartment,\n",
      "clearing his throat the while with that odd musical chirp which had\n",
      "already grown so irritating in the ears of denis de bealieu. he first\n",
      "possessed himself of some papers which lay upon the table; then he\n",
      "went to the mouth of the passage and appeared to give an order to the\n",
      "men behind the arras; and lastly he hobbled out through the door by\n",
      "which denis had come in, turning upon the threshold to address a last\n",
      "smiling bow to the young couple, and followed by the chaplain with a\n",
      "hand lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "no sooner were they alone than blanche advanced toward denis with her\n",
      "hands extended. her face was flushed and excited, and her eyes shone\n",
      "with tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you shall not die!\" she cried, \"you shall marry me after all.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "of death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, no, no,\" she said, \"i see you are no poltroon[8]. it is for my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i am afraid,\" returned denis, \"that you underrate the difficulty,\n",
      "madam. what you may be too generous to refuse, i may be too proud to\n",

      "silent for a moment, then walked suddenly away, and falling on her\n",
      "uncle's chair, fairly burst out sobbing. denis was in the acme of\n",
      "embarrassment. he looked round, as if to seek for inspiration, and,\n",
      "seeing a stool, plumped down upon it for something to do. there he\n",
      "sat, playing with the guard of his rapier, and wishing himself dead a\n",
      "thousand times over, and buried in the nastiest kitchen-heap in\n",
      "france. his eyes wandered round the apartment, but found nothing to\n",
      "arrest them. there were such wide spaces between the furniture, the\n",
      "light fell so badly and cheerlessly over all, the dark outside air\n",
      "looked in so coldly through the windows, that he thought he had never\n",
      "seen a church so vast, nor a tomb so melancholy. the regular sobs of\n",
      "blanche de maletroit measured out the time like the ticking of a\n",
      "clock. he read the device upon the shield over and over again, until\n",
      "his eyes became obscured; he stared into shadowy corners until he\n",
      "imagined they were swarming with horrible animals; and every now and\n",
      "again he awoke with a start, to remember that his last two hours were\n",
      "running, and death was on the march.\n",
      "\n",
      "oftener and oftener, as the time went on, did his glance settle on the\n",
      "girl herself. her face was bowed forward and covered with her hands,\n",
      "and she was shaken at intervals by the convulsive hiccough of grief.\n",
      "even thus she was not an unpleasant object to dwell upon, so plump and\n",
      "yet so fine, with a warm brown skin, and the most beautiful hair,\n",
      "denis thought, in the whole world of womankind. her hands were like\n",
      "her uncle's: but they were more in place at the end of her young arms,\n",
      "and looked infinitely soft and caressing. he remembered how her blue\n",
      "eyes had shone upon him, full of anger, pity, and innocence. and the\n",
      "more he dwelt on her perfections, the uglier death looked, and the\n",
      "more deeply was he smitten with penitence at her continued tears. now\n",
      "he felt that no man could have the courage to leave a world which\n",
      "contained so beautiful a creature; and now he would have given forty\n",
      "minutes of his last hour to have unsaid his cruel speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly a hoarse and ragged peal of cockcrow rose to their ears from\n",
      "the dark valley below the windows. and this shattering noise in the\n",
      "silence of all around was like a light in a dark place, and shook them\n",
      "both out of their reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"alas, can i do nothing to help you?\" she said, looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"madam,\" replied denis, with a fine irrelevancy, \"if i have said\n",
      "anything to wound you, believe me, it was for your own sake and not\n",
      "for mine.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i feel your position cruelly,\" he went on. \"the world has been\n",
      "bitter, hard on you. your uncle is a disgrace to mankind. believe me,\n",

      "afterward,\" she added, with a quaver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"most certainly,\" he answered, with a smile. \"let me sit beside you as\n",

      "\n",

      "gallant--and it somehow pains me. but draw nearer, if you please; and\n",
      "if you find anything to say to me, you will at least make certain of a\n",

      "forth--\"ah! monsieur de beaulieu, how can i look you in the face?\" and\n",
      "she fell to weeping again with a renewed effusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"madam,\" said denis, taking her hand in both of his, \"reflect on the\n",
      "little time i have before me, and the great bitterness into which i am\n",
      "cast by the sight of your distress. spare me, in my last moments, the\n",
      "spectacle of what i cannot cure even with the sacrifice of my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am very selfish,\" answered blanche. \"i will be braver, monsieur de\n",
      "beaulieu, for your sake. but think if i can do you no kindness in the\n",
      "future--if you have no friends to whom i could carry your adieux.\n",
      "charge me as heavily as you can; every burden will lighten, by so\n",
      "little, the invaluable gratitude i owe you. put it in my power to do\n",
      "something more for you than weep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my mother is married again, and has a young family to care for. my\n",
      "brother guichard will inherit my fiefs; and if i am not in error, that\n",
      "will content him amply for my death. life is a little vapor that\n",
      "passeth away, as we are told by those in holy orders. when a man is in\n",
      "a fair way and sees all life open in front of him, he seems to himself\n",
      "to make a very important figure in the world. his horse whinnies to\n",
      "him; the trumpets blow and the girls look out of window as he rides\n",
      "into town before his company; he receives many assurances of trust and\n",
      "regard--sometimes by express in a letter--sometimes face to face, with\n",
      "persons of great consequence falling on his neck. it is not wonderful\n",
      "if his head is turned for a time. but once he is dead, were he as\n",
      "brave as hercules[9] or as wise as solomon[10], he is soon forgotten.\n",
      "it is not ten years since my father fell, with many other knights\n",
      "around him, in a very fierce encounter, and i do not think that any\n",
      "one of them, nor so much as the name of the fight, is now remembered.\n",
      "no, no, madam, the nearer you come to it, you see that death is a dark\n",
      "and dusty corner, where a man gets into his tomb and has the door shut\n",
      "after him till the judgment day. i have few friends just now, and once\n",
      "i am dead i shall have none.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah, monsieur de beaulieu!\" she exclaimed, \"you forget blanche de\n",
      "maletroit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you have a sweet nature, madam, and you are pleased to estimate a\n",
      "little service far beyond its worth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is not that,\" she answered. \"you mistake me if you think i am\n",
      "easily touched by my own concerns. i say so because you are the\n",
      "noblest man i have ever met; because i recognize in you a spirit that\n",
      "would have made even a common person famous in the land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and yet here i die in a mousetrap--with no more noise about it than\n",

      "a look of pain crossed her face and she was silent for a little while.\n",
      "then a light came into her eyes, and with a smile she spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i cannot have my champion think meanly of himself. any one who gives\n",
      "his life for another will be met in paradise by all the heralds and\n",

      "for--pray, do you think me beautiful?\" she asked, with a deep flush.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"indeed, madam, i do,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am glad of that,\" she answered heartily. \"do you think there are\n",
      "many men in france who have been asked in marriage by a beautiful\n",
      "maiden--with her own lips--and who have refused her to her face? i\n",
      "know you men would half despise such a triumph; but believe me, we\n",
      "women know more of what is precious in love. there is nothing that\n",
      "should set a person higher in his own esteem; and we women would prize\n",
      "nothing more dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are very good,\" he said; \"but you cannot make me forget that i\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i am not so sure of that,\" she replied, holding down her head. \"hear\n",
      "me to an end, monsieur de beaulieu. i know how you must despise me; i\n",
      "feel you are right to do so; i am too poor a creature to occupy one\n",
      "thought of your mind, although, alas! you must die for me this\n",
      "morning. but when i asked you to marry me, indeed, and indeed, it was\n",
      "because i respected and admired you, and loved you with my whole soul,\n",
      "from the very moment that you took my part against my uncle. if you\n",
      "had seen yourself, and how noble you looked, you would pity rather\n",
      "than despise me. and now,\" she went on, hurriedly checking him with\n",
      "her hand, \"although i have laid aside all reserve and told you so\n",
      "much, remember that i know your sentiments toward me already. i would\n",
      "not, believe me, being nobly born, weary you with importunities into\n",
      "consent. i too have a pride of my own: and i declare before the holy\n",
      "mother of god, if you should now go back from your word already given,\n",
      "i would no more marry you than i would marry my uncle's groom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "denis smiled a little bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is a small love,\" he said, \"that shies at a little pride.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"come hither to the window,\" he said with a sigh. \"here is the dawn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "and indeed the dawn was already beginning. the hollow of the sky was\n",
      "full of essential daylight, colorless and clean; and the valley\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i will tell you what it is,\" began the dealer, with some sharpness,\n",

      "match of yours, and you have been drinking the lady's health.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"where is the hurry?\" returned markheim. \"it is very pleasant to stand\n",
      "here talking; and life is so short and insecure that i would not hurry\n",
      "away from any pleasure--no, not even from so mild a one as this. we\n",
      "should, rather cling, cling to what little we can get, like a man at a\n",
      "cliff's edge. every second is a cliff, if you think upon it--a cliff a\n",
      "mile high--high enough, if we fall, to dash us out of every feature of\n",
      "humanity. hence it is best to talk pleasantly. let us talk of each\n",

      "knows, we might become friends?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"true, true,\" said markheim. \"enough fooling. to business. show me\n",

      "through a haggard lift of his upper lip, his teeth looked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"this, perhaps, may suit,\" observed the dealer; and then, as he began\n",
      "to re-arise, markheim bounded from behind upon his victim. the long,\n",
      "skewer-like[4] dagger flashed and fell. the dealer straggled like a\n",
      "hen, striking his temple on the shelf, and then tumbled on the floor\n",
      "in a heap.\n",

      "and by that inconsiderable movement, the whole room was filled with\n",
      "noiseless bustle and kept heaving like a sea: the tall shadows\n",
      "nodding, the gross blots of darkness swelling and dwindling as with\n",
      "respiration, the faces of the portraits and the china gods changing\n",
      "and wavering like images in water. the inner door stood ajar, and\n",
      "peered into that leaguer[5] of shadows with a long slit of daylight\n",
      "like a pointing finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "from these fear-stricken rovings, markheim's eyes returned to the body\n",
      "of his victim, where it lay both humped and sprawling, incredibly\n",
      "small and strangely meaner than in life. in these poor, miserly\n",
      "clothes, in that ungainly attitude, the dealer lay like so much\n",
      "sawdust. markheim had feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing. and\n",
      "yet, as he gazed, this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began\n",
      "to find eloquent voices. there it must lie; there was none to work the\n",
      "cunning hinges or direct the miracle of locomotion--there it must lie\n",
      "till it was found. found! aye, and then? then would this dead flesh\n",
      "lift up a cry that would ring over england, and fill the world with\n",
      "the echoes of pursuit. ay, dead or not, this was still the enemy.\n",
      "\"time was that when the brains were out[6],\" he thought; and the\n",
      "first word struck into his mind. time, now that the deed was\n",
      "accomplished--time, which had dosed for the victim, had become\n",
      "instant and momentous for the slayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "the thought was yet in his mind, when, first one and then another,\n",
      "with every variety of pace and voice--one deep as the bell from a\n",
      "cathedral turret, another ringing on its treble notes the prelude of a\n",
      "waltz--the clocks began to strike the hour of three in the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "the sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb chamber staggered\n",
      "him. he began to bestir himself, going to and fro with the candle,\n",
      "beleaguered by moving shadows, and startled to the soul by chance\n",
      "reflections. in many rich mirrors, some of home designs, some from\n",
      "venice or amsterdam, he saw his face repeated and repeated, as it were\n",
      "an army of spies; his own eyes met and detected him; and the sound of\n",
      "his own steps, lightly as they fell, vexed the surrounding quiet. and\n",
      "still as he continued to fill his pockets, his mind accused him, with\n",
      "a sickening iteration[7], of the thousand faults of his design. he\n",
      "should have chosen a more quiet hour; he should have prepared an\n",
      "alibi; he should not have used a knife; he should have been more\n",
      "cautious, and only bound and gagged the dealer, and not killed him; he\n",
      "should have been more bold, and killed the servant also; he should\n",
      "have done all things otherwise; poignant regrets, weary, incessant\n",
      "toiling of the mind to change what was unchangeable, to plan what was\n",
      "now useless, to be the architect of the irrevocable past. meanwhile,\n",
      "and behind all this activity, brute terrors, like the scurrying of\n",
      "rats in a deserted attic, filled the more remote chambers of his brain\n",
      "with riot; the hand of the constable would fall heavy on his shoulder,\n",
      "and his nerves would jerk like a hooked fish; or he beheld, in\n",
      "galloping defile, the dock, the prison, the gallows, and the black\n",
      "coffin. terror of the people in the street sat down before his mind\n",
      "like a besieging army. it was impossible, he thought, but that some\n",
      "rumor of the struggle must have reached their ears and set on edge\n",
      "their curiosity; and now, in all the neighboring houses, he divined\n",
      "them sitting motionless and with uplifted ear--solitary people,\n",
      "condemned to spend christmas dwelling alone on memories of the past,\n",
      "and now startlingly recalled from that tender exercise: happy family\n",
      "parties, struck into silence round the table, the mother still with\n",
      "raised finger; every degree and age and humor, but all, by their own\n",
      "hearths, prying and hearkening and weaving the rope that was to hang\n",
      "him. sometimes it seemed to him he could not move too softly; the\n",
      "clink of the tall bohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell; and\n",
      "alarmed by the bigness of the ticking, he was tempted to stop the\n",
      "clocks. and then, again, with a swift transition of his terrors, the\n",
      "very silence of the place appeared a source of peril, and a thing to\n",
      "strike and freeze the passer-by; and he would step more boldly, and\n",
      "bustle aloud among the contents of the shop, and imitate, with\n",
      "elaborate bravado, the movements of a busy man at ease in his own\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "but he was now so pulled about by different alarms that, while one\n",
      "portion of his mind was still alert and cunning, another trembled on\n",
      "the brink of lunacy. one hallucination in particular took a strong\n",
      "hold on his credulity. the neighbor hearkening with white face beside\n",
      "his window, the passer-by arrested by a horrible surmise on the\n",
      "pavement--these could at worst suspect, they could not know; through\n",
      "the brick walls and shuttered windows only sounds could penetrate. but\n",
      "here, within the house, was he alone? he knew he was; he had watched\n",
      "the servant set forth sweethearting, in her poor best, \"out for the\n",
      "day\" written in every ribbon and smile. yes, he was alone, of course;\n",
      "and yet, in the bulk of empty house about him, he could surely hear\n",
      "a stir of delicate footing--he was surely conscious, inexplicably\n",
      "conscious, of some presence. ay, surely; to every room and corner\n",
      "of the house his imagination followed it; and now it was a faceless\n",
      "thing, and yet had eyes to see with; and again it was a shadow of\n",

      "with cunning and hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "at times, with a strong effort, he would glance at the open door which\n",
      "still seemed to repel his eyes. the house was tall, the skylight small\n",
      "and dirty, the day blind with fog; and the light that filtered down to\n",
      "the ground story was exceedingly faint, and showed dimly on the\n",
      "threshold of the shop. and yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness,\n",
      "did there not hang wavering a shadow?\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly, from the street outside, a very jovial gentleman began to\n",

      "name. markheim, smitten into ice, glanced at the dead man. but no! he\n",
      "lay quite still; he was fled away far beyond earshot of these blows\n",
      "and shoutings; he was sunk beneath seas of silence; and his name,\n",
      "which would once have caught his notice above the howling of a storm,\n",
      "had become an empty sound. and presently the jovial gentleman desisted\n",
      "from his knocking and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "here was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be done, to get forth\n",
      "from, this accusing neighborhood, to plunge into a bath of london\n",
      "multitudes, and to reach, on the other side of day, that haven of\n",
      "safety and apparent, innocence---his bed. one visitor had come: at\n",
      "any moment it another might follow and be more obstinate. to have\n",
      "done the deed, and yet not to reap the profit, would be too abhorrent\n",
      "a failure. the money, that was now markheim's concern: and as a means\n",
      "to that, the keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "he glanced over his shoulder at the open door, where the shadow was\n",
      "still lingering and shivering; and with no conscious repugnance of the\n",
      "mind, yet with a tremor of the belly, he drew near the body of his\n",
      "victim. the human character had quite departed. like a suit\n",
      "half-stuffed with bran, the limbs lay scattered, the trunk doubled, on\n",
      "the floor; and yet the thing repelled him. although so dingy and\n",
      "inconsiderable to the eye, he feared it might have more significance\n",
      "to the touch. he took the body by the shoulders, and turned it on its\n",
      "back. it was strangely light and supple, and the limbs, as if they had\n",
      "been broken, fell into the oddest postures. the face was robbed of all\n",
      "expression; but it was as pale as wax, and shockingly smeared with\n",
      "blood about one temple. that was, for markheim, the one displeasing\n",
      "circumstance. it carried him back, upon the instant, to a certain fair\n",
      "day in a fishers' village: a gray day, a piping wind, a crowd upon the\n",
      "street, the blare of brasses, the booming of drums, the nasal voice of\n",
      "a ballad singer; and a boy going to and fro, buried over head in the\n",
      "crowd and divided between interest and fear, until, coming out upon\n",
      "the chief place of concourse, he beheld a booth and a great screen\n",
      "with pictures, dismally designed, garishly[9] colored: brownrigg[10]\n",
      "with her apprentice; the mannings[11] with their murdered guest; weare\n",
      "in the death grip of thurtell[12]; and a score besides of famous\n",
      "crimes. the thing was as clear as an illusion; he was once again that\n",
      "little boy; he was looking once again, and with the same sense of\n",
      "physical revolt, at these vile pictures; he was still stunned by the\n",
      "thumping of the drums. a bar of that day's music returned upon his\n",
      "memory; and at that, for the first time, a qualm came over him, a\n",
      "breath of nausea, a sudden weakness of the joints, which he must\n",
      "instantly resist and conquer.\n",
      "\n",
      "he judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from these\n",
      "considerations; looking the more hardily in the dead face, bending his\n",
      "mind to realize the nature and greatness of his crime. so little a\n",
      "while ago that face had moved with every change of sentiment, that\n",
      "pale mouth had spoken, that body had been all on fire with governable\n",
      "energies; and now, and by his act, that piece of life had been\n",
      "arrested, as the horologist[13], with interjected finger, arrests the\n",
      "beating of the clock. so he reasoned in vain; he could rise to no more\n",
      "remorseful consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before\n",
      "the painted effigies of crime, looked on its reality unmoved. at best,\n",
      "he felt a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in vain with all\n",
      "those faculties that can make the world a garden of enchantment, one\n",
      "who had never lived and who was now dead. but of penitence, no, not a\n",
      "tremor.\n",
      "\n",
      "with that, shaking himself clear of these considerations, he found the\n",
      "keys and advanced toward the open door of the shop. outside, it had\n",
      "begun to rain smartly; and the sound of the shower upon the roof had\n",
      "banished silence. like some dripping cavern, the chambers of the house\n",
      "were haunted by an incessant echoing, which filled the ear and mingled\n",
      "with the ticking of the clocks. and, as markheim approached the door,\n",
      "he seemed to hear, in answer to his own cautious tread, the steps of\n",
      "another foot withdrawing up the stair. the shadow still palpitated\n",
      "loosely on the threshold. he threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his\n",
      "muscles, and drew back the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "the faint, foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare floor and\n",
      "stairs; on the bright suit of armor posted, halbert in hand, upon the\n",
      "landing; and on the dark wood carvings and framed pictures that hung\n",
      "against the yellow panels of the wainscot. so loud was the beating of\n",
      "the rain through all the house that, in markheim's ears, it began to\n",
      "be distinguished into many different sounds. footsteps and sighs, the\n",
      "tread of regiments marching in the distance, the chink of money in the\n",
      "counting, and the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar, appeared to\n",
      "mingle with the patter of the drops upon the cupola and the gushing of\n",
      "the water in the pipes. the sense that he was not alone grew upon him\n",
      "to the verge of madness. on every side he was haunted and begirt by\n",
      "presences. he heard them moving in the upper chambers; from the shop,\n",
      "he heard the dead man getting to his legs; and as he began with a\n",
      "great effort to mount the stairs, feet fled quietly before him and\n",
      "followed stealthily behind. if he were but deaf, he thought, how\n",
      "tranquilly he would possess his soul! and then again, and hearkening\n",
      "with ever fresh attention, he blessed himself for that unresting sense\n",
      "which held the outposts and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life. his\n",
      "head turned continually on his neck; his eyes, which seemed starting\n",
      "from their orbits, scouted on every side, and on every side were half\n",
      "rewarded as with the tail of something nameless vanishing. the\n",
      "four-and-twenty steps to the first floor were four-and-twenty agonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "on that first story the doors stood ajar, three of them like three\n",
      "ambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of cannon. he could\n",
      "never again, he felt, be sufficiently immured and fortified from men's\n",
      "observing eyes; he longed to be home, girt in by walls, buried among\n",
      "bed-clothes, and invisible to all but god. and at that thought he\n",
      "wondered a little, recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear\n",
      "they were said to entertain of heavenly avengers. it was not so, at\n",
      "least, with him. he feared the laws of nature, lest, in their callous\n",
      "and immutable procedure, they should preserve some damning evidence of\n",
      "his crime. he feared tenfold more, with a slavish, superstitious\n",
      "terror, some scission[14] in the continuity of man's experience, some\n",
      "wilful illegality of nature. he played a game of skill, depending on\n",
      "the rules, calculating consequence from cause; and what if nature, as\n",
      "the defeated tyrant overthrew the chessboard, should break the mould\n",
      "of their succession? the like had befallen napoleon (so writers said)\n",
      "when the winter changed the time of its appearance. the like might\n",
      "befall markheim: the solid walls might become transparent and reveal\n",
      "his doings like those of bees in a glass hive; the stout planks might\n",
      "yield under his foot like quicksands and detain him in their clutch;\n",
      "aye, and there were soberer accidents that might destroy him: if, for\n",
      "instance, the house should fall and imprison him beside the body of\n",
      "his victim; or the house next door should fly on fire, and the firemen\n",
      "invade him from all sides. these things he feared; and, in a sense,\n",
      "these things might be called the hands of god reached forth against\n",
      "sin. but about god himself he was at ease; his act was doubtless\n",
      "exceptional, but so were his excuses, which god knew; it was there,\n",
      "and not among men, that he felt sure of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "when he got safe into the drawing-room, and shut the door behind him,\n",
      "he was aware of a respite from alarms. the room was quite dismantled,\n",
      "uncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing cases and incongruous\n",
      "furniture; several great pier glasses, in which he beheld himself at\n",
      "various angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures, framed and\n",
      "unframed, standing, with their faces to the wall; a fine sheraton[15]\n",
      "sideboard, a cabinet of marquetry[16], and a great old bed, with\n",
      "tapestry hangings. the windows opened to the floor; but by great good\n",
      "fortune the lower part of the shutters had been closed, and this\n",
      "concealed him from the neighbors. here, then, markheim drew in a\n",
      "packing case before the cabinet, and began to search among the keys.\n",
      "it was a long business, for there were many; and it was irksome,\n",
      "besides; for, after all, there might be nothing in the cabinet, and\n",
      "time was on the wing. but the closeness of the occupation sobered him.\n",
      "with the tail of his eye he saw the door--even glanced at it from time\n",
      "to time directly, like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good\n",
      "estate of his defences. but in truth he was at peace. the rain falling\n",
      "in the street sounded natural and pleasant. presently, on the other\n",
      "side, the notes of a piano were wakened to the music of a hymn, and\n",
      "the voices of many children took up the air and words. how stately,\n",
      "how comfortable was the melody! how fresh the youthful voices!\n",
      "markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he sorted out the keys; and his\n",
      "mind was thronged with answerable ideas and images; church-going\n",
      "children and the pealing of the high organ; children afield, bathers\n",
      "by the brookside, ramblers on the brambly common, kite-flyers in the\n",
      "windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another cadence of the\n",
      "hymn, back again to church, and the somnolence of summer sundays, and\n",
      "the high, genteel voice of the parson (which he smiled a little to\n",
      "recall), and the painted jacobean[17] tombs, and the dim lettering of\n",
      "the ten commandments in the chancel.\n",
      "\n",
      "and as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was startled to his\n",
      "feet. a flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting gush of blood, went\n",
      "over him, and then he stood transfixed and thrilling. a step mounted\n",
      "the stair slowly and steadily, and presently a hand was laid upon the\n",
      "knob, and the lock clicked, and the door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "fear held markheim in a vice. what to expect he knew not, whether the\n",
      "dead man walking, or the official ministers of human justice, or some\n",
      "chance witness blindly stumbling in to consign him to the gallows. but\n",
      "when a face was thrust into the aperture, glanced round the room,\n",
      "looked at him, nodded and smiled as if in friendly recognition, and\n",
      "then withdrew again, and the door closed behind it, his fear broke\n",
      "loose from his control in a hoarse cry. at the sound of this the\n",
      "visitant returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"did you call me?\" he asked pleasantly, and with that he entered the\n",
      "room, and closed the door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "markheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes. perhaps there was a\n",
      "film upon his sight, but the outlines of the newcomer seemed to change\n",
      "and waver like those of the idols in the wavering candlelight of the\n",
      "shop: and at times he thought he knew him; and at times he thought he\n",
      "bore a likeness to himself; and always, like a lump of living terror,\n",
      "there lay in his bosom the conviction that this thing was not of the\n",
      "earth and not of god.\n",
      "\n",
      "and yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace, as he stood\n",
      "looking on markheim with a smile; and when he added: \"you are looking\n",
      "for the money, i believe?\" it was in the tones of everyday politeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "markheim made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i should warn you,\" resumed the other, \"that the maid has left her\n",
      "sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here. if mr. markheim\n",
      "be found in this house, i need not describe to him the consequences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you know me?\" cried the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "the visitor smiled. \"you have long been a favorite of mine,\" he said;\n",
      "\"and i have long observed and often sought to help you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what are you?\" cried markheim: \"the devil?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what i may be,\" returned the other, \"cannot affect the service i\n",
      "propose to render you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it can,\" cried markheim; \"it does! be helped by you? no, never; not\n",
      "by you! you do not know me yet; thank god, you do not know me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i know you,\" replied the visitant, with a sort of kind severity or\n",
      "rather firmness. \"i know you to the soul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"know me!\" cried markheim. \"who can do so? my life is but a\n",
      "travesty[18] and slander on myself. i have lived to belie my nature.\n",
      "all men do; all men are better than this disguise that grows about and\n",
      "stifles them. you see each dragged away by life, like one whom bravos\n",
      "have seized and muffled in a cloak. if they had their own control--if\n",
      "you could see their faces, they would be altogether different, they\n",
      "would shine out for heroes and saints! i am worse than most; myself is\n",
      "more overlaid; my excuse is known to me and god. but, had i the time,\n",
      "i could disclose myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to me?\" inquired the visitant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"to you before all,\" returned the murderer. \"i supposed you were\n",
      "intelligent. i thought--since you exist--you would prove a reader of\n",
      "the heart. and yet you would propose to judge me by my acts! think of\n",
      "it; my acts! i was born and i have lived in a land of giants; giants\n",
      "have dragged me by the wrists since i was born out of my mother--the\n",
      "giants of circumstance. and you would judge me by my acts! but can you\n",
      "not look within? can you not understand that evil is hateful to me?\n",
      "can you not see within me the clear writing of conscience, never\n",
      "blurred by any wilful sophistry[19] although too often disregarded?\n",
      "can you not read me for a thing that surely must be common as\n",
      "humanity--the unwilling sinner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"all this is very feelingly expressed,\" was the reply, \"but it regards\n",
      "me not. these points of consistency are beyond my province, and i care\n",
      "not in the least by what compulsion you may have been dragged away, so\n",
      "as you are but carried in the right direction. but time flies; the\n",
      "servant delays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the pictures\n",
      "on the hoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer; and remember, it\n",
      "is as if the gallows itself were striding toward you through the\n",

      "from a different side, and when the life is done my interest falls.\n",
      "the man has lived to serve me, to spread black looks under color of\n",
      "religion, or to sow tares[21] in the wheat field, as you do, in a\n",
      "course of weak compliance with desire. now that he draws so near to\n",
      "his deliverance, he can add but one act of service--to repent, to die\n",
      "smiling, and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more timorous\n",
      "of my surviving followers. i am not so hard a master. try me. accept\n",
      "my help. please yourself in life as you have done hitherto; please\n",
      "yourself more amply, spread your elbows at the board; and when the\n",
      "night begins to fall and the curtains to be drawn, i tell you, for\n",
      "your greater comfort, that you will find it even easy to compound your\n",
      "quarrel with your conscience, and to make a truckling peace with god.\n",
      "i came but now from such a death-bed, and the room was full of sincere\n",
      "mourners, listening to the man's last words; and when i looked into\n",
      "that face, which had been set as a flint against mercy, i found it\n",
      "smiling with hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and do you, then, suppose me such a creature?\" asked markheim. \"do\n",
      "you think i have no more generous aspirations than to sin, and sin,\n",
      "and sin, and, at last, sneak into heaven? my heart rises at the\n",
      "thought. is this, then, your experience of mankind? or is it because\n",
      "you find me with red hands that you presume such baseness? and is this\n",
      "crime of murder indeed so impious as to dry up the very springs of\n",
      "good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"murder is to me no special category[22],\" replied the other. \"all\n",
      "sins are murder, even all life is war. i behold your race, like\n",
      "starving mariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of the hands of\n",
      "famine and feeding on each other's lives. i follow sins beyond the\n",
      "moment of their acting; i find in all that the last consequence is\n",
      "death; and to my eyes, the pretty maid who thwarts her mother with\n",
      "such taking graces on a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with\n",
      "human gore than such a murderer as yourself. do i say that i follow\n",
      "sins? i follow virtues also; they differ not by the thickness of a\n",
      "nail, they are both scythes for the reaping angel of death. evil, for\n",
      "which i live, consists not in action but in character. the bad man is\n",
      "dear to me; not the bad act, whose fruits, if we could follow them far\n",
      "enough down the hurtling[23] cataract of the ages, might yet be found\n",
      "more blessed than those of the rarest virtues. and it is not because\n",
      "you have killed a dealer, but because you are markheim, that i offered\n",
      "to forward your escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i will lay my heart open to you,\" answered markheim. \"this crime on\n",
      "which you find me is my last. on my way to it i have learned many\n",
      "lessons; itself is a lesson, a momentous lesson. hitherto i have been\n",
      "driven with revolt to what i would not; i was a bondslave to poverty,\n",
      "driven and scourged. there are robust virtues that can stand in these\n",
      "temptations; mine was not so: i had a thirst of pleasure. but to-day,\n",
      "and out of this deed, i pluck both warning and riches--both the power\n",
      "and a fresh resolve to be myself. i become in all things a free actor\n",
      "in the world; i begin to see myself all changed, these hands the\n",
      "agents of good, this heart at peace. some thing comes over me out of\n",
      "the past; something of what i have dreamed on sabbath evenings to the\n",
      "sound of the church organ, of what i forecast when i shed tears over\n",
      "noble books, or talked, an innocent child, with my mother. there lies\n",
      "my life; i have wandered a few years, but now i see once more my city\n",
      "of destination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are to use this money on the stock exchange, i think?\" remarked\n",
      "the visitor; \"and there, if i mistake not, you have already lost some\n",
      "thousands?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah,\" said markheim, \"but this time i have a sure thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"this time, again, you will lose,\" replied the visitor, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah, but i keep back the half!\" cried markheim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that also you will lose,\" said the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "the sweat started upon markheim's brow. \"well, then, what matter?\" he\n",
      "exclaimed. \"say it be lost, say i am plunged again in poverty, shall\n",
      "one part of me, and that the worse, continue until the end to override\n",
      "the better? evil and good ran strong in me, hailing me both ways. i do\n",
      "not love the one thing, i love all. i can conceive great deeds,\n",
      "renunciations, martyrdoms; and though i be fallen to such a crime as\n",
      "murder, pity is no stranger to my thoughts. i pity the poor; who knows\n",
      "their trials better than myself? i pity and help them; i prize love, i\n",
      "love honest laughter; there is no good thing nor true thing on earth\n",
      "but i love it from my heart. and are my vices only to direct my life,\n",
      "and my virtues to lie without effect, like some passive lumber of the\n",
      "mind? not so; good, also, is a spring of acts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "but the visitant raised his finger. \"for six-and-thirty years that you\n",
      "have been in this world,\" said he, \"through many changes of fortune\n",
      "and varieties of humor, i have watched you steadily fall. fifteen\n",
      "years ago you would have started at a theft. three years back you\n",
      "would have blenched at the name of murder. is there any crime, is\n",
      "there any cruelty or meanness, from which you still recoil?--five\n",
      "years from now i shall detect you in the fact! downward, downward lies\n",
      "your way; nor can anything but death avail to stop you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is true,\" markheim said huskily, \"i have in some degree complied\n",
      "with evil. but it is so with all: the very saints, in the mere\n",
      "exercise of living, grow less dainty, and take on the tone of their\n",
      "surroundings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i will propound to you one simple question,\" said the other; \"and as\n",
      "you answer, i shall read to you your moral horoscope. you have grown\n",
      "in many things more lax; possibly you do right to be so; and at any\n",
      "account, it is the same with all men. but granting that, are you in\n",
      "any one particular, however trifling, more difficult to please with\n",
      "your own conduct, or do you go in all things with a looser rein?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"in any one?\" repeated markheim, with an anguish of consideration.\n",
      "\"no,\" he added, with despair, \"in none! i have gone down in all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"then,\" said the visitor, \"content yourself with what you are, for you\n",
      "will never change; and the words of your part on this stage are\n",
      "irrevocably written down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "markheim stood for a long while silent, and indeed it was the visitor\n",
      "who first broke the silence. \"that being so,\" he said, \"shall i show\n",
      "you the money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and grace?\" cried markheim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"have you not tried it?\" returned the other. \"two or three years ago,\n",
      "did i not see you on the platform of revival meetings, and was not\n",
      "your voice the loudest in the hymn?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is true,\" said markheim; \"and i see clearly what remains for me by\n",
      "way of duty. i thank you for these lessons from my soul; my eyes are\n",
      "opened, and i behold myself at last for what i am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "at this moment, the sharp note of the door-bell rang through the\n",
      "house; and the visitant, as though this were some concerted signal for\n",
      "which he had been waiting, changed at once in his demeanor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the maid!\" he cried. \"she has returned, as i forewarned you, and\n",
      "there is now before you one more difficult passage. her master, you\n",
      "must say, is ill; you must let her in, with an assured but rather\n",
      "serious countenance--no smiles, no overacting, and i promise you\n",
      "success! once the girl within, and the door closed, the same dexterity\n",
      "that has already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last\n",
      "danger in your path. thenceforward you have the whole evening--the\n",
      "whole night, if needful--to ransack the treasures of the house and to\n",
      "make good your safety. this is help that comes to you with the mask of\n",
      "danger. up!\" he cried: \"up, friend; your life hangs trembling in the\n",
      "scales: up, and act!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "markheim steadily regarded his counsellor. \"if i be condemned to evil\n",
      "acts,\" he said, \"there is still one door of freedom open--i can cease\n",
      "from action. if my life be an ill thing, i can lay it down. though i\n",
      "be, as you say truly, at the beck of every small temptation, i can\n",
      "yet, by one decisive gesture, place myself beyond the reach of all.\n",
      "my love of good is damned to barrenness; it may, and let it be!\n",
      "but i have still my hatred of evil; and from that, to your galling\n",
      "disappointment, you shall see that i can draw both energy and\n",
      "courage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful and lovely\n",
      "change: they brightened and softened with a tender triumph; and, even\n",
      "as they brightened, faded and dislimned[24]. but markheim did not\n",
      "pause to watch or understand the transformation. he opened the door\n",
      "and went downstairs very slowly, thinking to himself. his past went\n",
      "soberly before him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like\n",
      "a dream, random as chance-medley--a scene of defeat. life, as he\n",
      "thus reviewed it, tempted him no longer; but on the farther side he\n",
      "perceived a quiet haven for his bark. he paused in the passage, and\n",
      "looked into the shop, where the candle still burned by the dead body.\n",
      "it was strangely silent. thoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind,\n",
      "as he stood gazing. and then the bell once more broke out into\n",
